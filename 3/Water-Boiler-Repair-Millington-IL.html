<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
