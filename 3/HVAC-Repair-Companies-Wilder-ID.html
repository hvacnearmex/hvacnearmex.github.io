<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in houses. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating unit) with the same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
