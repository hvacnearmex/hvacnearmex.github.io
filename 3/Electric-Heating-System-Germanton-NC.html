<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
