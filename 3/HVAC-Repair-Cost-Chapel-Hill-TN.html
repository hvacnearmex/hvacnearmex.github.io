<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Chapel Hill TN</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to check the air conditioning unit prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
