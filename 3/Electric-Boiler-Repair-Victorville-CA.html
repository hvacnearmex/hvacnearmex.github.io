<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature level of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that ideal temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service strategy which generally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
