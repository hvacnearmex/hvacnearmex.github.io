<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, homes and schools matters, especially since we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>There are many things to take into account when attempting to find out how often I must change my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your cooling filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better ideal decision on how often your HVAC filters require replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less often you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one cooling filter need replacing more often.<p>
