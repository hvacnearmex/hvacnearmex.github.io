<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden floor joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish.
