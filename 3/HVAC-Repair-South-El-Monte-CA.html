The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
