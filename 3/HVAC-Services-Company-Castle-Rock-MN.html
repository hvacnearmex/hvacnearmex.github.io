Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
