<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on.

The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
