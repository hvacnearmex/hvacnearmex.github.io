<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up.
