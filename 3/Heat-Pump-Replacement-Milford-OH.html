Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
