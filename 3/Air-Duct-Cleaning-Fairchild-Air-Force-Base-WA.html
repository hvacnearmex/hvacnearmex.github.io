<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>There are a couple of main points that homeowners will want to take into account when deciding which of the best AC units they should set up in their homes. It actually depends on what you value the most in a leading brand central air conditioning conditioner. The major aspects for a lot of homeowners will be the total cost to install the best ac system brands, life expectancy of the AC system, guarantees offered, energy effectiveness (SEER ratings), and size of the system you require for your home's square footage (LOTS) to efficiently cool your home.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
