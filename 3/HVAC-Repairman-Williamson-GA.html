To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions.

<p>This is my 3rd time using All the time.
