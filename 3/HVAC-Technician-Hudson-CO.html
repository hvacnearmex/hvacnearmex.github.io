<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
