<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
