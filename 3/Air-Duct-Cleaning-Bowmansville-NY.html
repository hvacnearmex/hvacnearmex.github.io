<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
