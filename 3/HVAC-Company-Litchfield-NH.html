<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Litchfield NH Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
