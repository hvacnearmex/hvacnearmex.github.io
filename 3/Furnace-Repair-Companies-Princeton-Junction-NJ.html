<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for distributing cold and hot air throughout your home, supplying a comfy climate in every room. But ducts that are not set up properly or preserved can distribute contaminants from one room to another.
