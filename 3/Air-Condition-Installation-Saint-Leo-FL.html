<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a few years ago.<p>
