<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
