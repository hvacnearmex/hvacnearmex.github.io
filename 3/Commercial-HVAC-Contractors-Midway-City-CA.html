<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>For instance, issues occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in appropriate quantities of outside air. Insufficient ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or put in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Improperly located outside air consumption vents can likewise bring in air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
