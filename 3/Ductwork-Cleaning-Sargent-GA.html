They might advise that you trim back thick trees or bushes to ensure sufficient airflow around the system.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
