I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
