<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
