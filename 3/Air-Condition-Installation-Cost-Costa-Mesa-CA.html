<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems.

<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Costa Mesa CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
