<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
