<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are dealt with in a way that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these items present a danger only. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for considerable illness.<p>
