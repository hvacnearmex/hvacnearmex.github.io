<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>
