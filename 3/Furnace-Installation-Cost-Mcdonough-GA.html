<p>I normally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
