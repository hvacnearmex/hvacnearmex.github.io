<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
