<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
