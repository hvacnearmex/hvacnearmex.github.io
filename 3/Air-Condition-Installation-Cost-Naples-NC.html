They may suggest that you trim thick trees or bushes to ensure adequate air flow around the unit.<p>

The HVAC system may be polluted (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread these contaminants throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread out pollutants from one part of the home to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help decrease these problems.<p>

EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air toxins show that indoor levels of pollutants may be 2 to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five ecological health risks to the general public.<p>

Pressed wood items produced indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard includes a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is typically acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
