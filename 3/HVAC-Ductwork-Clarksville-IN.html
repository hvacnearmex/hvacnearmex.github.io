These various heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump run on electricity and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heater) with the very same quantity of electrical power.
