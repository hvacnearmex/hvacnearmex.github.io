<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
