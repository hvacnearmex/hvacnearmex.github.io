<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power ought to not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into account not only the small power of the units, however likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

More recent gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
