<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heating systems that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
