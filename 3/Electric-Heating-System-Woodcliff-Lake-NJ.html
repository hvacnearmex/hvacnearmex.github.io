<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
