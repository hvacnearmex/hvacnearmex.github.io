<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Carmel IN</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require reasonably little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is essential to keep the system operating efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leakages, the system ought to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water areas).

The collector's glass can be washed occasionally to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
