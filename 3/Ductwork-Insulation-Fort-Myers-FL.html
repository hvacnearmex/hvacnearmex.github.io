<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Fort Myers FL</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most inexpensive if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>These people have been great. At a realtor, I often require contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to contact these men twice. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the sincerity. Stability isn't just their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak with you soon.<p>
