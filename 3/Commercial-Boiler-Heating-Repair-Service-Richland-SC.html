<h3>Methods to Get the Most out of Your HVAC System in Richland SC</h3>
<p>Nobody needs to have to handle the inconvenience of setting up central air by themselves. No matter where you are in the installation procedure, we can assist by responding to any questions that you have, resolving problems that you have actually been dealing with, and thus making your central air installation as painless as possible. Call us today, and find just how much easier your central air conditioning installation can be.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
