<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Rockford MN</h3>
<p>Using air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy area recommends that "Air Purification need to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to decrease the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
