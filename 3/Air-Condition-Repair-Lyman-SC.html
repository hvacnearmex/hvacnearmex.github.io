<p>Heating systems are like cars. As they age, you can change one part just need another part changed or repaired next year. It doesn't take long to spend $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>To be sincere, few of the centers supervisors who use our indoor air quality tracking service concerned us because of that.
