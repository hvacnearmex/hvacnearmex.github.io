<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
