The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and unclean. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's efficiency. To make certain the system is working efficiently, think about having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
