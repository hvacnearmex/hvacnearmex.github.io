Makers usually continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard enters into result.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
