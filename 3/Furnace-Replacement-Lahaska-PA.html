<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
