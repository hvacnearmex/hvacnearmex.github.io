<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for monetary flexibility.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
