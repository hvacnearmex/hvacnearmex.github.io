<p>The properties and structure of the soil in a location can affect the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.

<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
<p>Think about potential results of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater.

While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
