It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest discomfort.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
