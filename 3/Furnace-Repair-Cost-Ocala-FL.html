<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
