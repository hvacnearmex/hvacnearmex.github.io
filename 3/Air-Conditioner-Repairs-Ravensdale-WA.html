<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem.
