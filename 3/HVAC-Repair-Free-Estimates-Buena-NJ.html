Not only will blocked vents and registers affect your comfort, they can likewise lead to duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to install.
