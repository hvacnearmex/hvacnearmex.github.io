<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
