<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in collecting information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.

If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
