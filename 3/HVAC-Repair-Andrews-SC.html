<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
