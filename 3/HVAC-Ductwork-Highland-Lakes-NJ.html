Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy.
