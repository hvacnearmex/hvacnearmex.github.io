<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in Chandler AZ</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the 3 strategies below may be proper.<p>
