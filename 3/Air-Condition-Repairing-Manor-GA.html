<p>A regular furnace tune up can make the most of efficiency and provide longer enduring house heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a basic maintenance call can identify a problem that will require a considerable investment to remedy. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the costly repair and enjoy ongoing convenience from your present heating system? Or, do you make an even bigger monetary dedication to changing the furnace?
