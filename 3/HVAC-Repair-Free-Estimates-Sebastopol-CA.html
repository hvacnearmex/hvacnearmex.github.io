<h3>Heating Installation in Sebastopol CA</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Throughout normal furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can build up on internal parts. Airborne aspects from regular household items and surfaces can lead to formicary corrosion within your HVAC devices.
