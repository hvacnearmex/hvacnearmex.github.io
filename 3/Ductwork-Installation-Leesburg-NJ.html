<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from office machines, cleaning products, building and construction furnishings, activities and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside toxins. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
