<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
