<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repeated use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing fractures and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a very useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
