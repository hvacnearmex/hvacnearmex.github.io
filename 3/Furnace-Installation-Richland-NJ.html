<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>The toxins noted in this guide have been revealed to cause the health impacts pointed out.

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
