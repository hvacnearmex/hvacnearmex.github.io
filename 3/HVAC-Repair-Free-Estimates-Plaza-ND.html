<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
