It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
