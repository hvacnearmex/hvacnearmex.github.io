<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
