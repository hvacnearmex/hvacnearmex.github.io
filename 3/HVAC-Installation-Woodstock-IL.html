<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary ecological threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
