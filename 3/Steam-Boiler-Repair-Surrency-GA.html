<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
