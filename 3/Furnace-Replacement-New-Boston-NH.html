<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy.
