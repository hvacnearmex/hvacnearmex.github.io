Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated home again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right prior to a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
