<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, as well as all other types of heat pumps, have performances ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a scientific way of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. Most geothermal heatpump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This indicates for every system of energy used to power the system, three to 5 systems are supplied as heat.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips.
