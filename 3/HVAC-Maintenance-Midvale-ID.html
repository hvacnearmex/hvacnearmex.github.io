<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
