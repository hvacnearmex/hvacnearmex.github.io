<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
