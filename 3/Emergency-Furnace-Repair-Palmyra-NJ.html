Naturally, too-dry air can likewise aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Most trustworthy HVAC service technicians will use totally free estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who try to provide you a complimentary quote over the phone, as it might not properly reflect what they will discover when they take a look at the system.

<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
