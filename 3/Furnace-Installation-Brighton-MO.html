<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
