<p>Indoor temperatures are often more tough to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
