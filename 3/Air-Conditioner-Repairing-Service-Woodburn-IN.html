<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
