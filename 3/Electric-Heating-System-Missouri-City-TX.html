HVAC professionals suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned up.

The following are guidelines; constantly refer to your owner's handbook. Note: Always shut off the power prior to cleaning the system.<p>
