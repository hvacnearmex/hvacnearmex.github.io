This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
