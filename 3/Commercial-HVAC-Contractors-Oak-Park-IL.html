Today's furnaces are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
