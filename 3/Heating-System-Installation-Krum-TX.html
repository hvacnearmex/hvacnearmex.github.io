<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
