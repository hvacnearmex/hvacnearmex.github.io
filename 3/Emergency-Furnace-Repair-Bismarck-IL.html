Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
