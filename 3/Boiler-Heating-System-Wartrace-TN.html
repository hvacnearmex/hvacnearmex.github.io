<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was kind of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact.

We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
