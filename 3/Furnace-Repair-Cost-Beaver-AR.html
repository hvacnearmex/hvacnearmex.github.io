<p>Today's home radiant heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a home is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one location like a restroom floor or be set up across the entire sub-surface of the house's floors. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
