<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
