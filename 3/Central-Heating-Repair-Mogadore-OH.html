<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Selecting Mogadore OH HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>The icing issue becomes far more extreme with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are typically installed in tandem with a more traditional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump throughout harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
