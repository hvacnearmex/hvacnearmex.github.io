<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at sensible energy costs. Your furnace has many elements that can affect the health and safety of you and your enjoyed ones. Having a total check of your furnace will provide assurance that it is safe to operate. Apotheosis Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Inspection of your furnace consists of a Health & Security Analysis, which inspects the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide leaks and polluted breathing air), checks the pilot security (explosion threat), checks the high limit (fire danger) and includes a visual examination for other risks.
