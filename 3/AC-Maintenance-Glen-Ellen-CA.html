<p>We're investing a lot more time indoors, these days. While many individuals presume pollution is just an outside issue, your house (and office) can likewise be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we don't think sufficient about exposure to all the important things we put in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- immediately, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Glen Ellen CA</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of scientific proof has indicated that the air within homes and other structures can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities.

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably reduces exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect modification, frequently shown by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you buy a new gas stove or range. Never utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
