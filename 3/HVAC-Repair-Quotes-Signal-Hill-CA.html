<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Signal Hill CA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
