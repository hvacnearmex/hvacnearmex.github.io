<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a really effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash.

By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
