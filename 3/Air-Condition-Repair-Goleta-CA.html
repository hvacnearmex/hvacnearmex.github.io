<p>Whatever heater you install, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should.

<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. If  it does not, you've offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
