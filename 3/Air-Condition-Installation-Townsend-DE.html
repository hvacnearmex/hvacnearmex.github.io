<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Company in Townsend</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
