<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
