<p>As a lot of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices producer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. Moreover, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often tough to measure, as one reaction mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented.
