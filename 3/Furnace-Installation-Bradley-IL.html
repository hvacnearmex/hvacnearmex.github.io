<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools required to check refrigerant levels.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still required to have an expert technician examine the system regularly.<p>

Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.

Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
