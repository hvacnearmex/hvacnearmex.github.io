<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
