<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd issue that sometimes shows up.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
