<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the growth of mold in moist air. The heat dries out the air, avoiding mold development and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can likewise aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally only available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best option for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
