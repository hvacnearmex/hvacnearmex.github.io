<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.)
