<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
