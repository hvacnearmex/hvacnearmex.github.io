<p>Last week, Target informed press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary intrusion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were taken from a third party supplier. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has operated at a variety of locations at Target and other leading merchants.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very handy in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
