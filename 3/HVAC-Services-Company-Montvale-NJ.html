I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
