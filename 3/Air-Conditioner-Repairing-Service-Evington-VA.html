<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually found the problem area in looking over the costs. He resolved the concern in one day, had actually adjusted the expense to what I considered reasonable before he called back, understood what may have caused the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not happen again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
