<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Braidwood IL</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they identified the issue and fixed really rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
