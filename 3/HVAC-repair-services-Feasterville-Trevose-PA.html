<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, considering that it is secured inside. When it does require to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.

In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
