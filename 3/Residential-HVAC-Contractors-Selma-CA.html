<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Selma CA?</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to purchase it. My wife stated that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have satisfied in a long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
