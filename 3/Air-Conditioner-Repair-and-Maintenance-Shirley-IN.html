When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
