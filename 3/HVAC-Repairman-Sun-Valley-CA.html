AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two.

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
