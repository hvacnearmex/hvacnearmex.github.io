<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
