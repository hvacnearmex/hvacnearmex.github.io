<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
