<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My wife said that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a long time.
