<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in top condition for the air conditioner to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the home. If the individual parts remain in appropriate order, the technician can analyze the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or excessive dirt. Sealing leaks in ductwork can improve HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and offer a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
