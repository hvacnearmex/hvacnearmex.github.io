<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was type of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we fixed concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time.
