<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
