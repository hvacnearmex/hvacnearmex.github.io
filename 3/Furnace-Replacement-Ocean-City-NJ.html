<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors.

Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.)
