<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Ardmore TN</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, dependable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>These guys have been great. At a real estate agent, I sometimes require contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a home might cost. Just recently I required to contact these people twice. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Speak to you quickly.<p>
