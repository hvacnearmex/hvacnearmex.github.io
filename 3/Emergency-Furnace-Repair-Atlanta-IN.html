You can discover the ASHRAE (American Society of Air-Conditioning, heating and refrigerating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>

The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they diagnosed the issue and repaired extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
