<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of toxin exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at house over the weekend. Area control includes moving the pollutant source far from occupants and even moving prone residents.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in building are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move airborne contaminants from areas of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
