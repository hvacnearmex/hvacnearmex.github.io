<h3>Heating Installation in Tracy CA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
