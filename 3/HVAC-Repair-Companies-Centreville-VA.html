<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Centreville VA</h3>
<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air may also be a problem.<p>
<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, nowadays. While many people assume contamination is simply an outside issue, your home (and workplace) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we do not think enough about direct exposure to all the things we place in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right now, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
