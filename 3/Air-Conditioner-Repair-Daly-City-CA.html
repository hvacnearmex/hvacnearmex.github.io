<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.
