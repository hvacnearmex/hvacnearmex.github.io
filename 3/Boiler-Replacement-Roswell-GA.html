<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may end up being stopped up, minimizing air flow quality, circulation, and volume. They also might become places for germs and molds to be and grow dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be appropriately maintained to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
