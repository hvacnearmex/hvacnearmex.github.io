<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon specific sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is very effective and beneficial, specifically during the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's house. This is because the excess heat soaked up from within the house is performed into the warm water tank instead of being transferred back into the earth.

Furthermore, throughout winter season, the heat from underground can be soaked up to heat domestic water together with its primary purpose of supplying space heating. This suggests that cost savings are still understood during the colder period. In fact, a desuperheater lowers winter season water heating costs by around half.<p>
