<p>Underfloor heating is easy to install, particularly if you make it part of a construct or renovation task. For example, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be set up as a Do It Yourself task as it is basic to lay down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and readily connected to the mesh, all set to be rolled out in place. Plus, there's even an added cleaning convenience as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
