<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

<p>Ac system producers normally make rugged, high quality items. If your a/c unit stops working, start by inspecting any fuses or breaker.

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Northridge CA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us debate which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the required electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
