<h3>Home AC Repair in Star City IN</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the outcome of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow. Workplace temperature levels need to be maintained between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by excessive air flow ought to be prevented.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might notice undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
