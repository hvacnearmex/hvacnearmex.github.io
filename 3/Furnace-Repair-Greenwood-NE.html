<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working, stability Energy was fast to respond. They showed up the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new furnaces can heat the house. Honestly, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his group fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
