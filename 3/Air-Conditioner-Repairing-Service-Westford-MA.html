<p>My eldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously.

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you need to do it frequently, it's probably time for an expert opinion.<p>
