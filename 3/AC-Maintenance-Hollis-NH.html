<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated performance benefit. Since they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since a system is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>

<h3>How to Get the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Hollis NH</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
