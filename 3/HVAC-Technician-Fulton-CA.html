Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources likewise determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be changed ultimately. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately twenty years.
