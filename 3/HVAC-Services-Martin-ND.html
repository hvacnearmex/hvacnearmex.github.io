<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
