A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the maker's directions.<p>

<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has stopped working.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
