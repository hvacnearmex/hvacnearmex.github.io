They weren't low-cost however a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part.

<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Wingina VA</h3>

That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
