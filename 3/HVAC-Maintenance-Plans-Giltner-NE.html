<p>Picking the best size ac system is an important part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll require an HVAC professional to assist you with. Here's why buying the best size ac system matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too big, you'll wind up squandering money and energy. And if it's too little, you will not get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>If your a/c unit is old, think about purchasing an energy-efficient design. Try to find the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central units are about 15% more efficient than basic models. New residential central air conditioning conditioner requirements entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the performance standards for central air conditioning conditioners for details, and consider acquiring a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher savings.<p>
