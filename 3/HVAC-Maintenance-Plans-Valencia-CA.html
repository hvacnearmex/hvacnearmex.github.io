<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants released by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high indoors may cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
