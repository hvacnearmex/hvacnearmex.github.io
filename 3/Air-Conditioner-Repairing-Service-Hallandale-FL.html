<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>

<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
