<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
