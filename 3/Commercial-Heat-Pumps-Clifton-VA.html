Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great opportunity; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
