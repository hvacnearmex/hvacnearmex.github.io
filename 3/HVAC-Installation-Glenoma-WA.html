<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, commercial, institutional, marine and residential duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The crucial part of your cooling is the outdoor unit. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its placement on your home and its maintenance, it may sustain some damage throughout the winter season. The majority of the time, this simply includes some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty easy to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the system and ensure that there is no rust, damage from collected moisture, or extreme wear to the outside. They may advise that you trim thick trees or bushes to guarantee sufficient airflow around the system.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration. Generally, SEER offers more data based on how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
