<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged.

The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
