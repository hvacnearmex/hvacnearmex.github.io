<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
