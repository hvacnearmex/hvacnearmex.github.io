<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
