<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
