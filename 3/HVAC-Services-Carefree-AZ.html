<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
