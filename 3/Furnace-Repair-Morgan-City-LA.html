The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in over half the work environment indoor air investigations it has performed.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Your Review This is my third time using All the time. Ilan always makes himself offered - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is skilled with these gadgets). I have absolutely nothing however excellent things to state - he has taken excellent care of my heating and AC needs. Quick action - fast resolution.<p>
