<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. Another aspect of the task is advising consumers as to how to prevent future problems and effectively preserve equipment by, for example, routinely oiling parts or altering filters.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
