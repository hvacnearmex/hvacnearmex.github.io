<h3>Tips for Quick Furnace Repair at Government Camp OR</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many people.<p>
