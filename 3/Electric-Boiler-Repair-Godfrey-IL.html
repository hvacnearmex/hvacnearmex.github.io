<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
