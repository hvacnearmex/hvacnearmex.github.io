<h3>The Way to Soundproof a Central Heating System in Virginia Beach VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

Also, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>
