<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Sacaton AZ</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
