<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Switch off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work properly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
