<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Picture 6).<p>

As HVAC professionals regularly enter into contact with wiring, they run the risk of being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of abrasions and burns to the skin. Although there are risks connected with the task, it is typically performed safely as long as correct care is taken.<p>
<p>A customized a/c unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
