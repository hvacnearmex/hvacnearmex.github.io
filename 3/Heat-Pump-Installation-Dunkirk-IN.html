<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators employed harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
