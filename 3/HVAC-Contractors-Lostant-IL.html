<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can usually be done in just a couple of minutes, typically without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
