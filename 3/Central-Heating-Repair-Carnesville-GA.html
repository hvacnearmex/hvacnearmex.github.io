<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved concerns. I would suggest this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
