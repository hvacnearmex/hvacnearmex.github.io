<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that consistently monitors energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save money on expenses (especially at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the stores change outside of an acceptable range that could avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
