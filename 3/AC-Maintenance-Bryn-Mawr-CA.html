<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>

Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this.
