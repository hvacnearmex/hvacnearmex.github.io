<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
