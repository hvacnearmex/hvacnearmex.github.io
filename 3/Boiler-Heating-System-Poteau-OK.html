The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Poteau OK</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to discover an honest AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

Electric heaters start at $395 and range approximately $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>

For example, homeowners might wish to search for one that features an integrated filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be changed.
