<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper change, typically suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you buy a new gas range or variety, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually. Never use a gas range to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
