<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste.

If you already have a home heater, you might try to find a heatpump more geared toward cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
