<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not use agreements.  The so called reputable companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night clothing.

How do I know. I now work as a consultant to verify the so called problems and solutions. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely wrong.<p>

All the damp hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then gotten rid of from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining pipes appropriately, you'll have a water leakage. A limitation in your drain pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are several locations a clog can happen. One of the primary areas where clogs begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen might cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
