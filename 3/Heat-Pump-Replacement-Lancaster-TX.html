<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
