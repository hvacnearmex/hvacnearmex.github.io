<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them till they have been correctly dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
