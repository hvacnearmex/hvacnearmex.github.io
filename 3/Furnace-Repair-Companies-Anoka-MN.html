<p>A geothermal desuperheater is useful and very efficient, specifically during the Summer while the system acts to cool one's home. This is because the excess heat absorbed from within the house is conducted into the warm water tank instead of being transferred back into the earth. The result, for that reason, is totally free warm water! Furthermore, throughout winter season, the heat from underground can be soaked up to heat domestic water alongside its main function of supplying space heating. This means that cost savings are still recognized throughout the colder duration. In reality, a desuperheater reduces winter water heating costs by around 50 percent.<p>
