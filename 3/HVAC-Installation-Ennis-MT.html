<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
