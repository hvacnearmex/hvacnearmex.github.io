<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They include delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, fetuses, and infants are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the damaging impacts of lead. Children may have greater exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
