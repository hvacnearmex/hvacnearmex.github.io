To ensure the system you select is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation quote to figure out the precise type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we do not simply change it with the exact same size system you currently have. These computations take into consideration things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>

If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
