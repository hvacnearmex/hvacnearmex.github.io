<p>The first ac system and refrigerators employed flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928.

So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
