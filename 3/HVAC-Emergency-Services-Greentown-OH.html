<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
