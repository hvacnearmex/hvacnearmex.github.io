Secondhand smoke is likewise hazardous to individuals, specifically children.<p>
<p>For instance, contaminants might collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption is located near a source of moisture or other outside contaminant, it might serve as a pathway to bring the pollutants inside.

Before choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>
