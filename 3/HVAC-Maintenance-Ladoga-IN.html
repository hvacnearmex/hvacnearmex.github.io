<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
