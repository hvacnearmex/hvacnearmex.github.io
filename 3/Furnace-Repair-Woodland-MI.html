<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for many years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly seem greater than typical, it is most likely time to think about a new system.

<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
