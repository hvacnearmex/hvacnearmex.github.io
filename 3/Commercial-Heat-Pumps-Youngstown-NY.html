<h3>HVAC Services Company in Youngstown NY</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the issue and repaired very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Annual furnace maintenance is the very best method to keep your heating unit working securely and effectively. That's why we offer our distinct Comfort First Subscription that makes preventive care easy and cost effective. Ask us about our maintenance program that can save you 25 percent on service over the life of your system. Because when you look after your furnace, it will look after you with lower energy costs, fewer repairs, and more years of convenience.<p>
