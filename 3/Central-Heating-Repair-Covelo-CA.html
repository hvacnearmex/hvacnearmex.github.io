<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
