<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion objective.
