The ventilation system determines the quality of the indoor air by controlling the amount of air that is added to the workplace atmosphere, the tidiness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its pollutants are either tired to the outdoors or re-circulated throughout the structure.<p>
<p>There are some more severe risks for HVAC workers that might be potentially deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be toxic. As HVAC specialists often come into contact with electrical wiring, they run the risk of being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of abrasions and burns to the skin.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
