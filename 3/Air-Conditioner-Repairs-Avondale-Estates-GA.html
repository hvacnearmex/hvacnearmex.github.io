Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
