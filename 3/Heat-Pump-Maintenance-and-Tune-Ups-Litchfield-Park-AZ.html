<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time.

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might see undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller sized wall-mounted units, ductless splits allow you to avoid the need for a full duct system like most other cooling systems require.
