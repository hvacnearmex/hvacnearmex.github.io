If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects may be worsened by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions common in the home.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a few years ago.<p>
