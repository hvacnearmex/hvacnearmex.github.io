The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>An excellent location to start is to compare your oil or natural gas furnace age to the nationwide average. The typical life span of heaters in homes today is in between 16 and twenty years. You should start shopping if your furnace is close to this age or older. Searching for a replacement furnace in an emergency does not permit time for you to make your finest choice. The majority of people prefer to change their furnace as a planned home enhancement instead of a panic replacement when your furnace is failing or has already common lifespan of a warm air furnace will differ based upon its operating environment, that's why it is essential to have the system serviced regularly by a certified technician. They will have the ability to properly evaluate the condition of the furnace and make any recommendations.<p>
