<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Utica MS</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
