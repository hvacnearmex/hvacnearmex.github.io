<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated efficiency benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
