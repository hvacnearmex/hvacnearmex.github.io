<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
