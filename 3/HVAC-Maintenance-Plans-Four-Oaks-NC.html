<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Four Oaks NC</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building is to reduce air leak through fractures and other openings in roofs, floorings, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor impurities tire them from the home.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be acquired and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many people.<p>

<p>Because the 1980s, makers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective. This was originally driven by rising energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological problems.

There are numerous approaches for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
