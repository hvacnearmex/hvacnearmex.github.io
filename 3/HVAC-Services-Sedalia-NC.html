<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, given that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
