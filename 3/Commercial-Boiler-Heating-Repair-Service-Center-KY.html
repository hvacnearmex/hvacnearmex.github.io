<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
