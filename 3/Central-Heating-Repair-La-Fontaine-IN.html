<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
