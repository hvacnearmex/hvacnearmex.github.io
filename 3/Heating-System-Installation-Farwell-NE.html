<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your house still heats to the best temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel extremely hot. If your home is not heating up, just be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you should employ a specialist to check and repair the unit.<p>
