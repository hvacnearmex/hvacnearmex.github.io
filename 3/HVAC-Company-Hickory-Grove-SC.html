<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Hickory Grove SC</h3>
<p>Aspects that can contribute to the development of biological contaminants are wet or damp building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and home plants.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
