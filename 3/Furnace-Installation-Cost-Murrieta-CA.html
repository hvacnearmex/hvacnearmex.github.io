After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
