It likewise prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
