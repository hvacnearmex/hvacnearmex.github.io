Producers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard goes into impact.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be contaminated (because of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread out these toxins throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread out pollutants from one part of the house to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can help decrease these issues.<p>
