<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
