<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had found the difficulty area in looking over the bill. He fixed the issue in one day, had actually changed the expense to what I considered reasonable before he recalled, understood what may have caused the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place once again. I have considered All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
