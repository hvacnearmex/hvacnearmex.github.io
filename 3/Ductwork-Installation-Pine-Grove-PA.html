The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
