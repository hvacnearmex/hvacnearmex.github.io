<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced.
