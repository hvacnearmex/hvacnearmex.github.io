<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
