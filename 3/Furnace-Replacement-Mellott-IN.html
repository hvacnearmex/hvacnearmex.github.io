<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
