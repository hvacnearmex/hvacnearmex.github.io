<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
