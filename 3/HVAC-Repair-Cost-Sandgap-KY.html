<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
