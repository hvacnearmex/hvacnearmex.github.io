<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
