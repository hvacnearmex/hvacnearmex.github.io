<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
