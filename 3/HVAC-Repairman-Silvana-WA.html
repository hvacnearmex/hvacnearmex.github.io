<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
