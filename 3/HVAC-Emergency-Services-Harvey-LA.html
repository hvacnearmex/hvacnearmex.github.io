I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were very professional, considerate and the work was very effectively done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn provided terrific customer care at the end of the visit by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the market.<p>
