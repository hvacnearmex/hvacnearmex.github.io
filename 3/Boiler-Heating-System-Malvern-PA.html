<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
