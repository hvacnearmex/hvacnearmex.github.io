<h3>Choosing the Right Bartlett IL Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is honest, trustworthy, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
