<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
