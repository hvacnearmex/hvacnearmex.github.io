Buildings constantly evolve as a result of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The different surfaces and the air inside a structure are continuously engaging, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For example, we might see a window as changing somewhat with time as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned, collects dirt again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see might be progressing as an outcome of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
