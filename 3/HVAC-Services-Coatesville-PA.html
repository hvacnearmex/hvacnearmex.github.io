<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In lots of split-system air conditioners, this indoor cabinet also includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

If your home already has no air but a furnace conditioner, a split-system is the most affordable central air conditioner to set up.<p>
<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Coatesville PA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the home. Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and germs, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
