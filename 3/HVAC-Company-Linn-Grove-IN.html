Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
