<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

To spot odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
