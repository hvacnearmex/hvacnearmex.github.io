<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
