<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
