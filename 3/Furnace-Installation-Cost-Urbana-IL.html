<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
