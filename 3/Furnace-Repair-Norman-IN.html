<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Norman IN</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and very educated. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week. Because the cost was clearly affordable, I did not trouble to get rival's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous people.<p>
