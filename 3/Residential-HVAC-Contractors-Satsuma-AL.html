<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
