<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") describes how inside air can impact an individual's comfort, health, and ability to work.

<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can expect a minimum of one month throughout which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 last year! Just a couple of years earlier, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have actually been plenty of long, dry, hot streaks ever since. When the heat gets intolerable, a central air conditioning system in your home indicates you have the power to change the temperature to a constant temperature.<p>

<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family home installation organisation entirely flip on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in collecting info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day.

The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
