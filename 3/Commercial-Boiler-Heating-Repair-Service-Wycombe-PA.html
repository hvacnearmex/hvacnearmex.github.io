<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
