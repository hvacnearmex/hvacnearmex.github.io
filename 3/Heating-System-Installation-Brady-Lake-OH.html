Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or positioned in such a method that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Improperly located outside air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>In more complex plans, warm air is permitted to stream and rise out high building openings to the outdoors (stack result ), triggering cool outdoors air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation plans can utilize really little energy, however care must be taken to guarantee comfort. In warm or humid environments, maintaining thermal comfort solely by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
