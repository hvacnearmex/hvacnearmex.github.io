<p>Lots of AC systems come with a number of special functions that can even more improve efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, property owners might wish to search for one that features a built-in filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to minimize energy expenses a lot more. Of course, more features mean greater central air expenses.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
