Numerous manufacturers state on guarantee documents that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC service provider belong of the service warranty conditions. When you have a ten-year parts minimal warranty as is standard on Carrier ® furnaces, you'll wish to make sure you keep that coverage valid for the full 10 years.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
