<h3>The Way to Choose a Specialist HVAC Technician in La Honda CA</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>Ventilation, air, and heating conditioning (HVAC) systems require routine maintenance and care. These are the systems that keep your house comfortable all year long.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
