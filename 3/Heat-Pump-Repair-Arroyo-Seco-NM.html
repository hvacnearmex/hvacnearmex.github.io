<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or changing air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
