<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and performance if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
