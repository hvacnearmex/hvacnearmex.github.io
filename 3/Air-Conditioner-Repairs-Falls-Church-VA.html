<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely extensive in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn provided excellent customer service at the end of the visit by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
