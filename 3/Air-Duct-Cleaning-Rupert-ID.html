<p>All Points Heating uses house air conditioning, ac system installation, ac system maintenance that deliver reliable, tested efficiency at high performance. Combustion products from car exhaust, heaters, water heaters, space heating systems, aromatic candle lights, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not correctly vented can generate carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items might lead to throat, eye, and nose inflammation; fatigue; dizziness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being blocked with particles that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.

As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
