Not only was the price great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
