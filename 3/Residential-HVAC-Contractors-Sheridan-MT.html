Air supply and return ducts come from inside through the house's outside wall or roofing to connect with the packaged air conditioning unit, which is normally located outdoors.

A basic air conditioning unit transfers heat out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
