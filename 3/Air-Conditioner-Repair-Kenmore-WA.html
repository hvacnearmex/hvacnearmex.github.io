<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
