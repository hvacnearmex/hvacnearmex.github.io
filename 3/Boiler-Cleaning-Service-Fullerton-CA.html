Since ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem extremely challenging initially, requiring specialized tools, devices, and knowledge.

<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other types of heat pumps, have actually efficiencies ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE.

My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
