<h3>Check Out Ductwork In Tecumseh MO Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Many people are aware that outside air contamination can affect their health, but indoor air contamination can also have considerable, damaging effect. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air toxins suggest that indoor levels of toxins might be two to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers consistently rank indoor air pollution among the top 5 ecological health dangers to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
