<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It may likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private spaces.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are great for additions due to the fact that they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
