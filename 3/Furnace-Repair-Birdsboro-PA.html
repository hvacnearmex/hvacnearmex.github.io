<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can show your home might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To spot odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
