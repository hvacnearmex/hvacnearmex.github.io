<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater air flow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air filtration technologies are ending up being more common as available options in residential and commercial HVAC item bundles. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been extensive, as customers remain mainly oblivious to the effects of air quality on health and productivity.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat irritant might induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those people who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>Because immunity varies greatly from specific to private, it is not useful to create a universal standard fit for all in terms of exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a ten years study evaluating more than 7,000 structures and over 25,000 environmental samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type included both commercial and residential. The majority of samples examined were tested favorable for bacteria and fungi.<p>
