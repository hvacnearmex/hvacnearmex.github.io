<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ¬∞ C (40-55 ¬∞ F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
