<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
