<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Cedar Springs MI - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
