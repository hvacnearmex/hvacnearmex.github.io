<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
