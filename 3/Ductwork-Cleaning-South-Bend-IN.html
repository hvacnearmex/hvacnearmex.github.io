<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trusted, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
