<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
