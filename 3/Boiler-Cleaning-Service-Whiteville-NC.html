<p>Sean was really valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
