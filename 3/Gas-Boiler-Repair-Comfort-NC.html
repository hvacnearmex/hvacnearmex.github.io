<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Comfort NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
