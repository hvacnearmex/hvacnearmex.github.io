<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Needs in Folsom CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>

The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
