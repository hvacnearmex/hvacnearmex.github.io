<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
