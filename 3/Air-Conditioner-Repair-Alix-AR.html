<p>Sean was really handy. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor.
