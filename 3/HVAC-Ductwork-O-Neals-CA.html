<p>Sean was really practical. He is a really pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor.

He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
