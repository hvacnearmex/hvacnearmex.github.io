<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>

<p>Start by checking out the installation manual and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Many systems feature a set that includes adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will guarantee an airtight and secure fit in the window opening.
