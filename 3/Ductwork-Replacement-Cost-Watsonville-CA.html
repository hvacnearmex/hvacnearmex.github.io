<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally higher than many heat pump choices, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the model you purchase.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
