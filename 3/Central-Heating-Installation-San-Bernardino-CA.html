<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than models made 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to replace or update your unit if it's five years old or older. The best central air conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while delivering the very same amount of cooling.<p>
