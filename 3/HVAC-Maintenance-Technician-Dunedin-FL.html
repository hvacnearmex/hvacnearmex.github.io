<h3>Benefits of Expert AC Repair in Dunedin FL</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
