<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in place. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a really helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
