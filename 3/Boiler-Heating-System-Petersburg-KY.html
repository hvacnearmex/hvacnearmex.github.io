<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
