<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Lovejoy GA</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
