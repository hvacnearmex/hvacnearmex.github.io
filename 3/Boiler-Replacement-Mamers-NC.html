Expect to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to set up central air if you do take our suggestion.

<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Inappropriate modification, often suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you purchase a brand-new gas range or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns constantly. Never use a gas range to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
