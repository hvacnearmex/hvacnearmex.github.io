<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
