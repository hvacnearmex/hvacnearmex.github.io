<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, since the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
