<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>

<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a house. Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be warmed in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a few feet below ground. In the summer months, the process reverses, thereby cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature remains continuous no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide consistent and trustworthy heating and cooling.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
