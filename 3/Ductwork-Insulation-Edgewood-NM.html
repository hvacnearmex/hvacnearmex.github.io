<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
