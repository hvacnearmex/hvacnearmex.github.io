They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My better half stated that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.
