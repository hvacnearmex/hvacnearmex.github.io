<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow constraint will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
