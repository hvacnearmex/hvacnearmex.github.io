<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Radiant VA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
