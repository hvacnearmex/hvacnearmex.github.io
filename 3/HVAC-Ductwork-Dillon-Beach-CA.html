<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
