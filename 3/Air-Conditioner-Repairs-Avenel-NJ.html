<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will typically build up in ductwork, restricting air flow. Since ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear very complicated at first, requiring specialized tools, devices, and knowledge. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
