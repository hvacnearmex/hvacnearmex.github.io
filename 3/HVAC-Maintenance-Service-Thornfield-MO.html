The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room.

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>

<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who described our choices did an outstanding job in ensuring we understood the pros and cons of each choice.
