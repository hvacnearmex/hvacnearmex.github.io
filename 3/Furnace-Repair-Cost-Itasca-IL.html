<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils.

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>. Prior to selecting the installation location of a/c unit, a number of main elements need to be considered. Firstly, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor units ought to not fall on the location of rest or workspace.

The outdoor system should also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be successfully discharged outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop greatly. It is highly recommended to install the air conditioner systems in quickly available places, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
