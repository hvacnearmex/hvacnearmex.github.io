<p>Energy performance can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by several thermostats.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck.

During high use months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
