<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated performance advantage.

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating unit. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which automatically shut down the heat pump if temperature levels drop and reach below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
