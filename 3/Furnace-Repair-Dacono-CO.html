<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
