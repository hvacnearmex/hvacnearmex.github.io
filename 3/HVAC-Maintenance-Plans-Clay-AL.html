<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Clay AL</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
