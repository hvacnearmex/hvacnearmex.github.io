Many typical building products utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling.
