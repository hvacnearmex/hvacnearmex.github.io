<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy.

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Bakersfield CA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to assist us discuss which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was remarkable.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
