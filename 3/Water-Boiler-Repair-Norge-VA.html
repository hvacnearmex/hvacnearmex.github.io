<p>Air toxins can vary from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant resulting from gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older houses may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your house.<p>

Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
