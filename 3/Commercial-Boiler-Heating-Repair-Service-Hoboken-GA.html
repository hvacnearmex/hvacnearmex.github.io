<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>New furnaces are considerably more effective than those of 10 or more years back, cutting costs by as much as 30%. To get long-lasting and repair-free efficiency from your new system, proper installation is a requirement. Brian and Sons Inc has the years of experience and hands-on product familiarity to respond to any challenges your home pay present.

Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter once every 3 months. During high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
