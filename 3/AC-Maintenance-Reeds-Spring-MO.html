<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
