<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
