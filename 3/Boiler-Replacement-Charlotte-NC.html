When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
