<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtration. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some standard maintenance.

<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your home from the ground below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products.

(Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new houses are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the home.
