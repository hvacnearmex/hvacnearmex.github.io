<p>A routine furnace tune up can go a long method towards decreasing much of the concerns triggered by build-up of dirt and debris, and the evaluations enable your contractor to monitor longer-term concerns and take proactive steps to help avoid premature failure or troublesome breakdowns during the heating season.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
