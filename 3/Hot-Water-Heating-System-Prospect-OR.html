<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

Winter utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that perfect temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service strategy which normally includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
