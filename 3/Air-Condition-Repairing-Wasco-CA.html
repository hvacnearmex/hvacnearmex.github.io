<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run because it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
