<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
