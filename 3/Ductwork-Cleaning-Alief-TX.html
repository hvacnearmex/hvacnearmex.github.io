<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold.

Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically only offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system.
