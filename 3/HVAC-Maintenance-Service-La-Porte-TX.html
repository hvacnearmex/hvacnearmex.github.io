<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
