<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home building and construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures.
