It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

<p>The split system is the most common. Most people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal components too. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple spaces at the same time, however are not very energy effective.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you must look out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
