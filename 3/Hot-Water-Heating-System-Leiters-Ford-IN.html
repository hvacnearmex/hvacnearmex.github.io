Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
