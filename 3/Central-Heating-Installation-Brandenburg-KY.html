<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
