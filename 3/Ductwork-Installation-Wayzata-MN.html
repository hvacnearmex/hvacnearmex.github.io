<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can limit airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance.

By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can usually be performed in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

Bear in mind that energy-star rated equipment will conserve you money in the end but may include a greater up-front cost.<p>
