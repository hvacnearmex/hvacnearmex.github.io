<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become an important issue to house owners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution research studies have identified numerous contaminants that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion products, volatile natural compounds (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Appropriate ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are very important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants might collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting toxins into the environment.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
