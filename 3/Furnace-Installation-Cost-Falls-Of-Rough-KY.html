<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on often may be due to an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
