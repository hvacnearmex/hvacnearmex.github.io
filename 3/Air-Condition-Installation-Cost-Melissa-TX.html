<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
