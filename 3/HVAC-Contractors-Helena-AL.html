<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Helena AL</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine scenario & decided to choose them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air going however likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke with from starting to end were extremely expert, polite and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When talking about options for HVAC replacement, Bryant air conditioning brand name is another terrific brand name that requires to be thought about. Bryant is a well known brand name that provides AC units, heatpump, and gas furnaces. It is fairly priced and is a sister company to some of the other top brands on our list. Bryant a/c are frequently made with the same quality parts as a Provider brand HVAC system.

<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service contract tries to upsell you every time they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
