<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary freedom.
