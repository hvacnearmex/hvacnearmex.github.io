<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
