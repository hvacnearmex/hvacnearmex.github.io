<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on regularly may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
