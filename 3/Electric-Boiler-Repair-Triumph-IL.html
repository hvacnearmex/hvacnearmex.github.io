<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
