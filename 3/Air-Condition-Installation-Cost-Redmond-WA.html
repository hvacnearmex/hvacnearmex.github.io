<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
