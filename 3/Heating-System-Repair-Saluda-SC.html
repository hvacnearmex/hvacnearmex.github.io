<p>The heat pump acquired appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from various sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground.

Perhaps Real estate agents need to consider too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system might contribute to, or deduct from, any provided asking rate. That said, property buyers seeking to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>

<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one significant downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
