<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
