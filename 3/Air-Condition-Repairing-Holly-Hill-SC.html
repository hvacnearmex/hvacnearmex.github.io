<p>The purpose of most building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at affordable energy expenses. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. As with measuring the size of a system needed based on BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.

<p>Great Product! Delivery was sort of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
