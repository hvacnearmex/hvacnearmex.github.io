After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
