<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
