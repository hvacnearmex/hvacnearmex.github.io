<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that perfect temperature throughout the year.

Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which typically consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>

While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
