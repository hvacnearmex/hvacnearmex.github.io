<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
