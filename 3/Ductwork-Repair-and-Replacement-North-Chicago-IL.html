The current pattern in house construction is to reduce air leak through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>
