<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as essential when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's growth does not always translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The heating, air and ventilation conditioning company tends to run cold and hot. When customers need their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather arrives, demand warms up during the summer and winter.<p>
