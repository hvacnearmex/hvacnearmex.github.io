<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
