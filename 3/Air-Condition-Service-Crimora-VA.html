<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Crimora VA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
