<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts.

As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
