<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
