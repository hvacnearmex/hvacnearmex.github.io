<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
