<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts.

As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
