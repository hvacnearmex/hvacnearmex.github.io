<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for many years.

New heating devices is far more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills right now, not to discuss the cash you'll save on repair expenses. You can probably expect to cut your fuel expenses in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the best temperature.
