<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
