If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. As with determining the size of a system required based upon BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Since it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you are aware it is in your house.

The effects of CO direct exposure can vary greatly from person to individual depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
