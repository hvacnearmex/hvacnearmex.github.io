This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Immediate effects might appear after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is simply getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up right after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  an extremely useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
