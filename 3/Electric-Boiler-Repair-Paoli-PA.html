<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we suggest utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size.

Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
