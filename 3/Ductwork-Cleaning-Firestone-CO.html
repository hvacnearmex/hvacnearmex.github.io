<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
