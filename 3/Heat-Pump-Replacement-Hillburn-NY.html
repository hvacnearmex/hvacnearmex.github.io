<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits.
