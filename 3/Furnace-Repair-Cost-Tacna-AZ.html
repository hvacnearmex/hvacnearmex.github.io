<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>

After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
