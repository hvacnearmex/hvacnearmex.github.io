<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; flooring, furnishings and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
