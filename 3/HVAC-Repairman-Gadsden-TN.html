<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

<p>Buildings are designed or planned to respond actively to a few of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
