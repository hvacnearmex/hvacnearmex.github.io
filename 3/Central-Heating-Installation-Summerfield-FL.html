<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family house installation company totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Ensure all the registers in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
