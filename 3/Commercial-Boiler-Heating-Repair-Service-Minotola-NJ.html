<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.
