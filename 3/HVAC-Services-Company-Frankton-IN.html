<p>Great service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in explaining what services would be performed.

<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma.

<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
