<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma.

<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation.
