<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being blocked with debris that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down totally. By comparison, replacing a furnace and checking filter can usually be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
