<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Repair in Norwalk CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
