<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
