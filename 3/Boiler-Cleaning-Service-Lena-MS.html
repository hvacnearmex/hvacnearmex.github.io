<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or abilities required to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Sometimes a momentary indoor air quality problem is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex problems-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the three techniques below may be suitable.<p>
