<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the prospective to adversely affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more reliable service to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>
