<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is simple to install, especially if you make it part of a build or renovation project.
