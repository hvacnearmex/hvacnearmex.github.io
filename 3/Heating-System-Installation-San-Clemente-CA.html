<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in San Clemente CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Installing air conditioning costs between $3,350 and $5,912 with many house owners reporting spending $4,631 on average. This cost is typical of setting up a new AC system to your forced air furnace. Other choices consist of single window systems or portable systems for $234 to $700 or ductless mini splits for $660 to $4,500. Your overall cost depends on the type and size of a/c system you require.<p>
