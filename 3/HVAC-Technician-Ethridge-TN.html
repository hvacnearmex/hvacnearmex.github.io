HVAC professionals advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
