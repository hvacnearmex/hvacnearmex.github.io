For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one significant downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or exceptionally hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
