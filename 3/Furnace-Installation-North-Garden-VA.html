<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings can not be effectively recognized or treated without a detailed building examination. These investigations might begin with composed questionnaires and telephone consultations in which structure private investigators evaluate the history of occupant signs and structure operation treatments. In some cases, these inquiries may quickly uncover the issue and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
<p>A third method to decide whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can indicate your home might not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or stinky air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To detect smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
