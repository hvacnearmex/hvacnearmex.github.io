<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are offered to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Care! Climate Pro is trustworthy and truly cared about us and our situation. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right prior to a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
