<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
