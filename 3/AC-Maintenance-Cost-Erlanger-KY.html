The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system.

Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not easy, since it considers not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
