<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less common now than gas, however they can be beneficial in more remote regions where energies are more difficult to gain access to, and in colder environments since it provides more heat per BTU than other services. The installation cost will be lower, however energy expenses will be greater, as much as 3 times greater than gas or electric heaters. They need a tank on the immediate property and more maintenance.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate.

The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
