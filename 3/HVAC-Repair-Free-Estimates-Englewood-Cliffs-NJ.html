<p>A lot of reputable HVAC service technicians will use complimentary estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who try to give you a complimentary quote over the phone, as it may not accurately show what they will find when they have a look at the system.

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your home is located, the local area's environment can change considerably. A home situated in the South would need an AC system with a size capable of cooling your house due to heat Summers. A home in the Northern part of the United States would need a much larger heating capability too which will affect expenses. See the chart listed below for the typical central air conditioning conditioner replacement expenses by LOADS.<p>
