<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
