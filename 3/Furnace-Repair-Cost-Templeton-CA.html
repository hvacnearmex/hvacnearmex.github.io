"Humidifier fever" is a typical illness triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Different fungi and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>Since 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Advancement (HUD) has allowed only the use of plywood and particleboard that conform to specified formaldehyde emission limitations in the building of prefabricated and mobile houses. In the past, some of these homes had raised levels of formaldehyde because of the big quantity of high-emitting pushed wood products utilized in their building and because of their fairly little interior space.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
