<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Lancaster NY</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
