<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
