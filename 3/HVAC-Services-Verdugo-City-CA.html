If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the humidity, cooling, or heating conditions widespread in the house.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
