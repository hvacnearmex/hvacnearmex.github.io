<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
