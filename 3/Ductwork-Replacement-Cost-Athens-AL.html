<h3>AC Maintenance in Athens AL</h3>
<p>Although installation is easy and doesn't need much time, trying this job is not an excellent concept.

<p>Oehl Heating, Electric, & A/c, Inc opened for service in 1949 to provide Amana, IA, and surrounding area homeowners with quality pipes, air conditioning, heating, and electrical services.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company utilized 98% of the existing material purchased with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health hazard reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new resident I have found out how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
