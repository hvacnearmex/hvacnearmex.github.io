<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Ventilation Systems in Weatherford TX</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
