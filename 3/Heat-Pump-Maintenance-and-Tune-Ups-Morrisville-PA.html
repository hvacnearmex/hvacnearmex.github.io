<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family home installation company completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living.
