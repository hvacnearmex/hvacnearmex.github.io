<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
