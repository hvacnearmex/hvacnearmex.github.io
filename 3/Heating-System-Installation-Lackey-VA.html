<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
