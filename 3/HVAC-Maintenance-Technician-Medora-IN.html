<p>These concepts-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- may currently be altering. Though only 33 percent of Seattle real estate systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new housing units have actually been integrated in the four years since or are presently under building. The huge majority of these systems are multi-family or mixed-use, where air conditioning is more of a market requirement, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering company Glumac.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
