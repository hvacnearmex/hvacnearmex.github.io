<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Edison NJ</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
