<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
