<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
