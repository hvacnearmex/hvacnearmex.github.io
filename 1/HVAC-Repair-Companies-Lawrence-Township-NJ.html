<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Lawrence Township NJ</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in house construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floors.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>
