<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace.

Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
