<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand.

Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
