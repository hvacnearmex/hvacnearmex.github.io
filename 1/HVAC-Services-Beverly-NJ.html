<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines.

<p>Next, and perhaps simply as crucial when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
