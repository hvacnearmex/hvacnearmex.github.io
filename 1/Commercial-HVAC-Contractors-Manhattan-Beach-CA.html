<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

These products provide a risk only when they are handled in a way that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled.

This can lead to the potential for substantial health problems.<p>
