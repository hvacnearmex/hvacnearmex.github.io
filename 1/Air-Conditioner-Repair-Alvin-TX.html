<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
