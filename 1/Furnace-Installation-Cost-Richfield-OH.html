<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Initially, you'll require one that is properly sized for your house. A furnace that is too big will put out excessive heat for your system to manage, and will trigger issues like short-cycling that can reduce its life. A furnace that is too little, on the other hand, will not be able to provide adequate heat to keep your house comfy.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all situated in one cabinet, which typically is put on a roof or on a concrete slab beside your home's foundation.

Packaged air conditioners typically include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of a/c and central heating system eliminates the need for a separate furnace indoors.<p>
