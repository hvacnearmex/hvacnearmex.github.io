<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Montpelier IN</h3>
<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stale air" conditions.

<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air path.

Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
