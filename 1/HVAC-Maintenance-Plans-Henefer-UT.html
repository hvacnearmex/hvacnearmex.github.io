Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
