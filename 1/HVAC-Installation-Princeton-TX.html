The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outside unit.

Because an unit is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
