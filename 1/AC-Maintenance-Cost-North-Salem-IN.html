<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They met my needs entirely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing extra items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
