Many common structure materials used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials.

An example of time control is setting up floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Place control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents or even relocating prone residents.<p>
<p>When setting up radiant heat, you should give major thought to the type of flooring covering in the home. Ceramic tile works well since it performs and shops heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work fairly well.

Additional TEAM studies show that while individuals are utilizing products containing natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to extremely high contaminant levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
