<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
