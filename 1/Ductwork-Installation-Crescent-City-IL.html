<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might see moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your physician about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently essential to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping track of information is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this data may identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
