Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to purchase it. My partner said that she had actually seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have satisfied in a long time.
