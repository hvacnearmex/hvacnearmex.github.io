<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Ravensdale WA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
