<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of issue.

<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
