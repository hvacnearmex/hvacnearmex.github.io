<p>Simplify your services, earn more services profits, and supply an incredible consumer experience. To ensure the system you pick is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load computation quote to identify the specific kind of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we don't simply change it with the same size unit you currently have.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
