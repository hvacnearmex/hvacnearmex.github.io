<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically brought on by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which results in a buildup of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in over half the work environment indoor air investigations it has performed.

These investigations exposed that correct ventilation is important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>

Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and viruses, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

(And these costs can be substantial. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, homeowners can expect to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.)
