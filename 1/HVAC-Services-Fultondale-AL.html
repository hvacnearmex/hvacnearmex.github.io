<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, homes and schools matters, especially considering that we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in extremely damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less efficient. Central air conditioning systems and heatpump normally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated lifespan, replacement might be the most affordable service.<p>
