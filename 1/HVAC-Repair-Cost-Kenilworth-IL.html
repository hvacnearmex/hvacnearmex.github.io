<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
