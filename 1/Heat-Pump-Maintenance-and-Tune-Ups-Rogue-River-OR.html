<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
