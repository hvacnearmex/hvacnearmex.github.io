<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
