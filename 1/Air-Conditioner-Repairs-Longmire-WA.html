<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
