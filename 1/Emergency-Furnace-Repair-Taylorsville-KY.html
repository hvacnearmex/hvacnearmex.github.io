This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room a/c offers maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
