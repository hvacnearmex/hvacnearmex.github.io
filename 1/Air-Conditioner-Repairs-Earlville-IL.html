<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Earlville IL</h3>

These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions require.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
