<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
