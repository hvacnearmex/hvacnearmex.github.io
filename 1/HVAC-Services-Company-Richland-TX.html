Most pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.. a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
