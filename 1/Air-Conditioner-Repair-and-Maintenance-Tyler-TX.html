<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
