<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Cinebar WA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years back and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
