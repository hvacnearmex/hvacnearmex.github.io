<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
