<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have been effectively dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might discover moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
