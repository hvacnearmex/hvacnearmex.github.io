If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.

Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
