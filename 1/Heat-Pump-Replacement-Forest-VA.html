<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Forest VA</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay items.

EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides additional information on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air pollutants.<p>
