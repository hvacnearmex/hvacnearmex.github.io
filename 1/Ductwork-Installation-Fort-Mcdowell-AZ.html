<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.
