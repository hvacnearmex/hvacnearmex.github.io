<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house.

Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your house feeling cold if this happens. You may likewise need to check your insulation to make sure that warm air does not escape from your space through different openings.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
