<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Elfers FL</h3>
<p>As a skilled HVAC specialist, we recommend you have your systems inspected and routine maintenance carried out twice per year, once in the Spring (before cooling season) and as soon as in the Fall (prior to heating season).

Keeping what is most likely the most pricey and important system in your home (heating & cooling) effectively preserved will help keep your most significant financial investment of your life in great shape.<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found simply a few feet below ground. In the summer months, the procedure reverses, thus cooling a home by eliminating heat. Underground temperature level remains consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer consistent and reputable cooling and heating.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a vehicle radiator or common home ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
