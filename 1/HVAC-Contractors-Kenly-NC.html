<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Kenly NC</h3>
<p>The majority of people are aware that outside air contamination can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can likewise have considerable, hazardous effect. EPA research studies of human exposure to air contaminants indicate that indoor levels of pollutants may be two to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five ecological health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
