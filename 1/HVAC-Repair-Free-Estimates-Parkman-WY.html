<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
