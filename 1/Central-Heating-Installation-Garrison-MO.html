<p>Although installation is easy and does not require much time, trying this task is not an excellent concept.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
