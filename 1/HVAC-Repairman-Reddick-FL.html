<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your car.

Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter when every 3 months. During high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the service technicians believed they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>

<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe short cycling in extremely cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the very low temperatures.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
