<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
