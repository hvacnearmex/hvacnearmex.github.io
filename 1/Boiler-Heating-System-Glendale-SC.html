<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>It is particularly important to take as a number of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can produce high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.

<p>Old heating systems typically start to make some weird noises as they get toward completion of their life.
