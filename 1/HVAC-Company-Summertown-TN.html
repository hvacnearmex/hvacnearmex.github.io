<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have.
