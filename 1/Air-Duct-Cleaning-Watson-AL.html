<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Numerous AC systems include a variety of unique functions that can further improve efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, homeowners might want to look for one that includes an integrated filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on during the night to reduce energy expenses much more. Naturally, more functions indicate greater central air costs.<p>
