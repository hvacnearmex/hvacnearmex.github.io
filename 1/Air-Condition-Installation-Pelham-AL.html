<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

For example, residential HVAC installation should be priced in a different way from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service ought to be priced differently from duct cleaning.
