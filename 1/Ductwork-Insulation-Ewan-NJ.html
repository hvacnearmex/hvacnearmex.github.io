<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.
