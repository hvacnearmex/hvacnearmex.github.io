The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, since the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level.
