He solved the issue in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I considered reasonable prior to he called back, knew what might have triggered the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again.

Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
