<p>There are some more serious threats for HVAC employees that might be possibly deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be dangerous.

Although there are dangers related to the job, it is normally performed securely as long as correct care is taken.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as an automobile radiator or common family a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Blooming Glen PA?</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
