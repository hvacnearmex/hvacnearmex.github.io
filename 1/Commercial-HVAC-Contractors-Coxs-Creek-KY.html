<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who operates in security for a company that produces much of the plastic utilized around the globe, including EMV. He's stated several times that the special code function is optional and many, many merchants do not use it because it slows down deals even more due to the back-and-forth interactions required. I don't understand sufficient about the innovation to know if that is even possible.<p>

<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can remain and collect in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be deadly). Signs of these illness do not show up until several years after exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some industrialized disease from exposure to clothing and devices brought home from job sites.<p>

<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
