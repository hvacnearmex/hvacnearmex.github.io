<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
