Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
