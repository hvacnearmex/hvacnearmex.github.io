<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Whippany NJ</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
