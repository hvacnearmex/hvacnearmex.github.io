<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced.
