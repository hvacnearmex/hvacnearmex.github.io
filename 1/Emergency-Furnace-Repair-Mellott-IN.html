<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
