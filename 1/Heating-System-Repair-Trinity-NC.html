<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Trinity NC</h3>

Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
<p>I extremely recommend using this service. Very trustworthy exceptionally great. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty fast and effective and did not have to pay a leg and an arm to get it done. Terrific company started by a man who is wanting to grow his company and protect his household. He set up a complete system inside and out. Terrific unit and a very good cost. I am currently on the maintance strategy. He looks after it twice a year with out needing to be advised to do it.<p>
