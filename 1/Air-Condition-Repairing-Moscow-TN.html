A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
