Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
