<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the exact same period. Basically, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
