<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
