<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, so many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a vicious, terrible summertime.<p>
