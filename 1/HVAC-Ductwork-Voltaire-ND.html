<p>Heaters are like cars and trucks. As they age, you can replace one part just need another part changed or fixed next year. It does not take long to invest $500 simply to keep an old oil or natural gas furnace running. Heaters incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was type of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.
