<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Clarkridge AR?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
