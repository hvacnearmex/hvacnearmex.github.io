<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
