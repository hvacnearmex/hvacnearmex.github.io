<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Oftentimes, if products have stopped working to dry a number of days after the believed water occasion, mold development is believed within wall cavities even if it is not immediately noticeable.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same method as an automobile radiator or normal household air conditioner does.
