<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold may be residing in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. However much of the things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of airborne pollutants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in many cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary danger of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More major than most allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to set off episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious breathing disease.<p>

<h3>Central Heating System in Stockbridge GA</h3>
<p>Recently, Target informed reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were stolen from a third party vendor. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in concern was a heating, refrigeration and air  conditioning subcontractor that has actually operated at a number of places at Target and other leading merchants.<p>
<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy intake and temperature levels in stores to save on expenses (particularly at night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores vary outside of an acceptable range that might prevent clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
