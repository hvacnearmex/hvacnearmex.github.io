<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Employ professionals and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated experts carry out better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
