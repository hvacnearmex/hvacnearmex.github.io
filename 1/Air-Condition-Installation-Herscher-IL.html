<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become air-borne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks.
