<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants also.<p>
<p>If your single stage air conditioning system isn't old enough to justify replacement, think about a whole home dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, improving indoor air quality and enabling greater comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>
