<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Though it might be hard to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your home, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, however result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best choice for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
