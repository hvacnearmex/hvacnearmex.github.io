<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time.

I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
