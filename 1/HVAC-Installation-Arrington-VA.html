<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
