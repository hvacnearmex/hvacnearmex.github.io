<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is created for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building products, smoking, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene area heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in produced items. For instance, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as an element of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and covering items.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Children, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Children might have greater exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
