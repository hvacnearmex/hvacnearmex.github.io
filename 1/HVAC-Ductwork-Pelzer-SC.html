<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
