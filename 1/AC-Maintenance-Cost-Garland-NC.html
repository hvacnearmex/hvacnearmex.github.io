<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators.
