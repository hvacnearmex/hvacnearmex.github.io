<p>They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs entirely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pressing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents. Unlike other kinds of a/c, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to understand and preserve.<p>
