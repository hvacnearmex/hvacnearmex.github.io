<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use agreements.. The so called reliable companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night clothing. Since I tried to work for them, I understand. I stop because 90% of them are scoundrels. They walk in with or without a contract and begin selling you things you do not need. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as a consultant to confirm the so called issues and solutions. 9 out of 10, I check are completely incorrect.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
