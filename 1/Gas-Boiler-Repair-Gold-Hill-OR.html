<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
