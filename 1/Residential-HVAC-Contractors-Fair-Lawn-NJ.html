<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
