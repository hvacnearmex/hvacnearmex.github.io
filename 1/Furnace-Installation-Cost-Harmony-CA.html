<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
