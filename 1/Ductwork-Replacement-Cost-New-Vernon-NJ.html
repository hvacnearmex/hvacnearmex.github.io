<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
