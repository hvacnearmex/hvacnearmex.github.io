<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
