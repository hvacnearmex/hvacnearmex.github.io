<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
<p>When attempting to figure out how often I need to replace my air conditioning filters, there are many things to take into consideration.
