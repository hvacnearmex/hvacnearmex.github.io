Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
