<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and helpful, Ballard Gas gave us a better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heater and located ways we might have more even heat. He consisted of these substantial but small modifications in his quote. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of current warmer summer seasons and for environmental reasons.<p>
