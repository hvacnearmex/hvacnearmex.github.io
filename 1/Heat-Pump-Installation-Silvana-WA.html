<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
