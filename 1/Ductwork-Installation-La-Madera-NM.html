<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools needed to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>
