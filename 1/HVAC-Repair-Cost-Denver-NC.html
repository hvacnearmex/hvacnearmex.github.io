Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, paints, and cleaners utilized in the home. To compound the issue, it is estimated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time indoors, and more than half that time is invested in the home.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities supervisors who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service came to us because of that. Generally they were at first interested in remotely monitoring some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't till later, as they continued dealing with us, that they learned about and implemented indoor air quality keeping an eye on to provide a healthier, more secure building environment-- and to avoid the unfavorable consequences connected with indoor air toxins.<p>
