<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in houses.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
