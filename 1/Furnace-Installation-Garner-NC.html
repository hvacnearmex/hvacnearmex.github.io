<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Garner</h2>

<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to industrial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
