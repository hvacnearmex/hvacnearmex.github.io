<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
