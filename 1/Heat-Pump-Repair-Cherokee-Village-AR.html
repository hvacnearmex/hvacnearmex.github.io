Some sources, such as developing materials, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release pollutants basically continuously.

<p>The first air conditioners and fridges used hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
