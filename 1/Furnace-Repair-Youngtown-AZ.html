We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins.

If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
