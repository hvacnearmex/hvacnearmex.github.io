<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same.

Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
