Every one of our heating and air service service technicians, plumbers and electrical contractors strive to provide the very best customer care experience possible and as winners of Lincoln's 2014 Better Business Bureau Integrity Award, we know these efforts have not gone unnoticed.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the trouble location in looking over the expense. He dealt with the concern in one day, had actually changed the costs to what I considered reasonable prior to he recalled, knew what may have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not happen again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually utilized them. This experience validates that.<p>

A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heatpump usually require excavation to set up, which includes a number of thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
