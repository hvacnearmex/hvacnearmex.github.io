<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Saddle Brook NJ</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need fairly little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is important to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be checked a minimum of two times per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
