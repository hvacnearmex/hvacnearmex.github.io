<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
