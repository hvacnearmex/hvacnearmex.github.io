<h3>Heater Repair in San Mateo CA</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally triggered by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the main problem in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has carried out. Examinations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These examinations exposed that appropriate ventilation is important in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
