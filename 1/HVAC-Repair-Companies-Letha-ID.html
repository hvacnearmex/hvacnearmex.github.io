<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Letha ID</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
