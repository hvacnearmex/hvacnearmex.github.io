<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
