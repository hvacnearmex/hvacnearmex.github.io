Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed simply a couple of years back.<p>

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
