<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are offered to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Care! Climate Pro is dependable and really appreciated us and our situation. We got back one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could look for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my friends.<p>
