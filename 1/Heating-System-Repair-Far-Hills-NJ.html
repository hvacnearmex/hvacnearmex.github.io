Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
