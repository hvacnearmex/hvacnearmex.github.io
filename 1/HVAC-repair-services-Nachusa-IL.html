<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we could have more even heat. He consisted of these significant however small modifications in his quote. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons.<p>
