<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Greeley CO</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
