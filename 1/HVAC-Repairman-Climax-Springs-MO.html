<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
