<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient.

(He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
