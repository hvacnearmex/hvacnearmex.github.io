<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>Homes can have the very same indoor air issues as single-family homes because a number of the pollution sources, such as the interior building products, furnishings, and home items, are comparable.

<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works however your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
