<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Understand in Auburndale WI</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
