<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
