<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
