<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

More serious than many allergenic properties is the capability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a serious respiratory disease.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and practical, Ballard Gas provided us a much better deal, for remarkable service. Instead of a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating system and situated methods we might have more even heat. He included these minor but considerable modifications in his quote. Because of recent warmer summer seasons and for ecological reasons, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
