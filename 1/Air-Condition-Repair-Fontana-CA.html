<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to briefly cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
