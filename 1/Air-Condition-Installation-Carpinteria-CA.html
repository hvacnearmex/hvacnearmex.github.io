<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
