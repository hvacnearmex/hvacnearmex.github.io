<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in East Bend NC</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last job is to evaluate the system to make sure it cools successfully. HVAC systems are operated through the thermostat. This final check might mention faults in the thermostat, which might be as easy as a need to change batteries. A failure to turn on may simply include a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician talks about any issues or problems and makes suggestions about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
