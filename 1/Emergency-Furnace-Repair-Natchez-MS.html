<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll save money over the long term due to the fact that of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as standard air-source systems.
