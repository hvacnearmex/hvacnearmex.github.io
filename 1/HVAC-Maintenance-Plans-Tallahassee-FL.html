<h3>House Ventilation in Tallahassee FL</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: They were great! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs entirely by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
