<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that collects during summer seasons. The best thing to do is ensuring that the heating system burners are inspected and cleaned thoroughly before chillier seasons start.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
