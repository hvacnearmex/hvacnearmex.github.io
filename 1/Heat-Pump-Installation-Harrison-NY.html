<p>All heating unit have some level of air purification. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the home. Pollutants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
