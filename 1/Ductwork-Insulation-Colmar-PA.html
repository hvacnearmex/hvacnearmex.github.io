<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be successfully recognized or fixed without a detailed structure examination. These investigations might start with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which structure private investigators assess the history of resident symptoms and structure operation treatments. In some cases, these queries might rapidly reveal the problem and on-site check outs are unnecessary.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
