Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>If you wish to conserve yourself money and time over the long term, having yearly maintenance performed on the furnace is a good idea.

An efficient system suggests less repairs, so you will not need to be as thorough when it concerns searching for signs of trouble and the month-to-month costs will be less. Having regular maintenance on your furnace offers numerous benefits that you will notice over the course of the entire year.<p>
