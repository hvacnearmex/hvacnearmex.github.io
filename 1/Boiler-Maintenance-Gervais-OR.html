<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Gervais OR</h3>
<p>For entire house installations, it's tough, if nearly difficult, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing house, especially a hydronic system. Localized radiant floor heat systems to be used in one or a number of rooms like restrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are quickly remodelled with electric radiant flooring heat. This is a lot more economical on a smaller scale. Larger remodellings like additions to a house might be suitable for a bigger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
