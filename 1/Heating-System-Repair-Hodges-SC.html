<p>Elements that can add to the growth of biological contaminants are wet or wet building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and badly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease caused by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.

Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and family plants.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and then change it ON.

You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
