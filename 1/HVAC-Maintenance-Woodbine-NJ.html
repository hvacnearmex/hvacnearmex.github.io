<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
