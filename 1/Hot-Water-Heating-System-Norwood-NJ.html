<p>Even if you do not feel dirty, pollen clings to your hair and clothing where it can quickly irritate your nose and eyes, and add to indoor air contamination. Don't have time for a fast rinse? At least clean your hands to get rid of sticking around pollen, specifically prior to reaching food or your face, suggests the Asthma and Allergic Reaction Structure of America. Try these techniques to pollen-proof your life, especially throughout allergy season.<p>
<p>Some health effects may show up quickly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a toxin. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant results are typically short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some diseases such as asthma may show up, be worsened or gotten worse.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can anticipate a minimum of 1 month during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Simply a couple of years back, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have been lots of long, dry, hot streaks ever since. When the heat gets intolerable, a central air conditioning system in your house indicates you have the power to change the temperature to a constant temperature.<p>
