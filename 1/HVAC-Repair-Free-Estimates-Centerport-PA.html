<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
