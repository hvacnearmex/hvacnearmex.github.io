<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to flow and increase out high building openings to the outside (stack effect ), causing cool outdoors air to be drawn into low building openings.
