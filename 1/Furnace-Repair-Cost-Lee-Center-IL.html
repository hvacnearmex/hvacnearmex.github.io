Signs that can show your home might not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To find odors in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
