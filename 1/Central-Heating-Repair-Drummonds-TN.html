<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
