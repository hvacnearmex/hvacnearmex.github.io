In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this issue due to the fact that they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Moreover, since they do not rely upon fans, ducts, registers and returns to distribute hot air, in-floor heating unit can lower the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
