<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives generally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new construction (houses normally use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
