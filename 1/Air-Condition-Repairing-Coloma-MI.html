<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.
