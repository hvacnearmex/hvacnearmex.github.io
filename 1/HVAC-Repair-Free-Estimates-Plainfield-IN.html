<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same.

Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
