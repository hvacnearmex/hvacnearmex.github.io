<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Important Organisation in Los Angeles. Switched to utilizing Wachoff's about a year ago and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have managed the one repair I required well, and are constantly on-time and expert. Have been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I have actually had the chance to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been great.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps run on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like an area heating system) with the exact same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved issues. I would advise this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time.
