<p>House heating systems are made complex systems that require the services of a contractor to install. While you can definitely purchase your furnace yourself, most contractors will not guarantee the furnace or may not install it if you do not buy it from them. Installation costs vary throughout the county, but start at approximately $50 per hour as much as $150 or more. It takes around five hours to set up a small furnace and more to install a large one.<p>
<p>We look at ideas before we provide recommendations to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>
