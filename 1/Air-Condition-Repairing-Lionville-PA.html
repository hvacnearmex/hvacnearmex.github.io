High-efficiency designs cost more, but conserve more over the long haul. Prices for gas heating systems vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heating systems begin at $395 and vary approximately $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
