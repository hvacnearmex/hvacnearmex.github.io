<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>

Damaging exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is incorrectly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>A health survey need to be established and distributed to all worried workers. Such a tool should identify the number of individuals impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they are located within the workplace; show when the symptoms take place (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of specific health symptoms or illnesses; recognize all machines operated in the work environment; suggest the kind of outside air contamination; and identify prospective sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
