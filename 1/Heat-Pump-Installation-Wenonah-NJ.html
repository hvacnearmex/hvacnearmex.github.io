<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater incomes for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or just a high level of competition for experienced trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest average incomes for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>The most common type of house heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive option, but newer systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective gas heaters can achieve AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Regardless of the type of electric radiant floor heater, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or altered. Any interference or disturbance in the circulation of electrical energy makes the system inoperable. This is one of the downsides to setting up an electric convected heat system. Nevertheless, presuming they are set up correctly and effectively looked after, the probability of them having issues is little.<p>
