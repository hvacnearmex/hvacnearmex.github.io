<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace since it's the most typical heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.
