<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
