<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and harden-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
