Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for financial freedom.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
