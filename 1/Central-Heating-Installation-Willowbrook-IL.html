<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
