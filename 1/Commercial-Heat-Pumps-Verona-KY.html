Running on electricity, a heatpump is a cost-efficient service utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse.

<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
