<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, given that a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room.
