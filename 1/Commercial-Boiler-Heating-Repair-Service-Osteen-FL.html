<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the difficulty area in looking over the bill.

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
