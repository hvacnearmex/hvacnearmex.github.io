<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance.

By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be done in just a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
