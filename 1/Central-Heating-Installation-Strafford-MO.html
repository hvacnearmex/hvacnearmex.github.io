<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
