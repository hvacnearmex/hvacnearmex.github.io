Nevertheless, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is related to a greater prevalence of resident breathing problems.<p>
