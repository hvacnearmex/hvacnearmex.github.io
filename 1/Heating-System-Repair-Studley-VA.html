They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to order it. My better half said that she had actually seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have fulfilled in a long time. We need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating.
