<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
