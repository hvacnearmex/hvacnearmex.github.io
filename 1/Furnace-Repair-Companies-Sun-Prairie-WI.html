They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to order it. My other half stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a long period of time.
