<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
