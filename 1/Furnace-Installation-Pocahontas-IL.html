<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
