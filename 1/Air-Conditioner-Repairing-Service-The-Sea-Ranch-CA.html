<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, particularly if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned and changed frequently. The heating & cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will worsen. Examining and changing the air filters is one of the most important elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outdoors air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
