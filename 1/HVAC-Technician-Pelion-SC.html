<h2>How To Hire HVAC Companies in Pelion</h2>

<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
