<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of eco-friendly homes as part of the growing green building movement. Green jobs represented 20 percent of all freshly built houses in the U.S. last year. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal article forecasted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire housing market.<p>
