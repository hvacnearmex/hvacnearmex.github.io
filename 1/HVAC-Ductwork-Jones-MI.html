<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
