<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Radiant heating offers a variety of unique benefits over forced air heating unit. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.
