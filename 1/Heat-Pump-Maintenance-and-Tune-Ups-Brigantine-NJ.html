<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stagnant air might also be an issue when ventilation is not enough to represent an increase in the number of workers in the location.<p>
<p>When installing the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one included excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is quite costly. Setting up a brand-new geothermal heat pump to deal with an existing ground loop is far more affordable.<p>

In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, pipes, and many other items.<p>
