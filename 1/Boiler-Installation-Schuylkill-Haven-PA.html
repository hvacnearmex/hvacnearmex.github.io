<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
