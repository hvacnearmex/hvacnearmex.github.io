<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>

Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
