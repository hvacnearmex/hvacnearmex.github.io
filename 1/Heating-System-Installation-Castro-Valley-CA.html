<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Castro Valley CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
