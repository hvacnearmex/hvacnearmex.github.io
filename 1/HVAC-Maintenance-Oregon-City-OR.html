<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Oregon City OR</h3>
<p>Everyone deal with a variety of threats to our health as we tackle our day-to-day lives. Driving in cars and trucks, flying in planes, taking part in leisure activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all pose varying degrees of risk. Some threats are merely inevitable. Some we choose to accept since to do otherwise would limit our ability to lead our lives the way we want. If we had the opportunity to make educated options, and some are dangers we might choose to prevent. Indoor air pollution is one threat that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
