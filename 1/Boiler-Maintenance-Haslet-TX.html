<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate because it just takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
