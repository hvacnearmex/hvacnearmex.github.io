<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
