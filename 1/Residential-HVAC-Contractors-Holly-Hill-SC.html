<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>

The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
