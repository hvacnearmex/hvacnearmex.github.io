<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher.

Evaluation of this information may determine possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring data may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
