After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
