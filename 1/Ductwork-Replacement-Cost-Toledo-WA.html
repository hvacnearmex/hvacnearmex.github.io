<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
