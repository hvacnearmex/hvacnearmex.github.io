<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets ask for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
