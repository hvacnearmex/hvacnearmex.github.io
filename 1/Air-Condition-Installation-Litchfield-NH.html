<p>The majority of people don't know how humidity is gotten rid of from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
