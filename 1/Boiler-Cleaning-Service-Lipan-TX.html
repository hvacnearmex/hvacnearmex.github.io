<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
