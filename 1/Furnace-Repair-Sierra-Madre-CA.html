They weren't cheap however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective.

<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is an extremely pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault.

The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
