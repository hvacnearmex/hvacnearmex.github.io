Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure materials, smoking cigarettes, household products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems.

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
