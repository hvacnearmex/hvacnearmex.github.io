Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from natural gas that leaves into your home without being burnt.

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Since it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you know it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers mild results that are frequently incorrect for the influenza. These signs include headaches, dizziness, tiredness, disorientation and queasiness. The impacts of CO exposure can vary significantly from person to person depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
