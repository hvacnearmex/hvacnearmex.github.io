<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Ola ID Home</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
