By contrast, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be done in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

It does not rely on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
