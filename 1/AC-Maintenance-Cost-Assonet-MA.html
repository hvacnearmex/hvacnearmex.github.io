<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
