<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergies, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing toxins.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
