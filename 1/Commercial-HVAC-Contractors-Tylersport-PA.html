<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
