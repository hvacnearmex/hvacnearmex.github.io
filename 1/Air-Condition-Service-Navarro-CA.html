<p>My eldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny.
