<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, instead of industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
