<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and viruses, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
