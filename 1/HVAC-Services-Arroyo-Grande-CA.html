<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. For example, promoting maintenance services to existing consumers throughout the slow season can help relieve the peak season strain on your tech crew, as kept in mind in Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Technicians can mostly focus on responding to calls from new consumers, while your established consumers stay happy as their HVAC systems hum along well thanks to proactive checkups.

<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less effective.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
