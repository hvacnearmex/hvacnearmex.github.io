<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
