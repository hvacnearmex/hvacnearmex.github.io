<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged.

<p>Both must be kept clean due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
