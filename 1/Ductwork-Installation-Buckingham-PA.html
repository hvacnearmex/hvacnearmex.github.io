<p>All Points Heating provides home air conditioning, ac system installation, a/c unit maintenance that deliver dependable, proven efficiency at high performance. Combustion items from auto exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, space heating systems, scented candle lights, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not effectively vented can generate carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items may lead to eye, nose, and throat inflammation; fatigue; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, kids, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
