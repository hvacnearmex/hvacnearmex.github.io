<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
