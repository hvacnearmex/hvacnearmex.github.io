<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
