<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the system has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
