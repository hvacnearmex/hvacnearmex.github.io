While toxins typically discovered in indoor air can cause numerous damaging impacts, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are needed to produce particular illness.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
