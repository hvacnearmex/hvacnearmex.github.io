<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
