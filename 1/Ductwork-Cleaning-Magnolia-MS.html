<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Magnolia MS</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
