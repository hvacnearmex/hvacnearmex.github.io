Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
