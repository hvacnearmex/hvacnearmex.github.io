The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
