<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
