<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day.

He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
