Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
