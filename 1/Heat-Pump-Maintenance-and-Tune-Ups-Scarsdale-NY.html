<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted 2 local companies for bids. While both were practical and informative, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a better deal, for extraordinary service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and located methods we could have more even heat. He included these significant however small modifications in his quote.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
