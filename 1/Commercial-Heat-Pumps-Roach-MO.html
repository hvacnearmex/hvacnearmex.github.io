Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a harsh, cruel summer.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
