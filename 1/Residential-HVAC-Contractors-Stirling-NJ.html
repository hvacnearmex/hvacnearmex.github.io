<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for many years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs unexpectedly appear higher than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system. New heating devices is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills right away, not to point out the cash you'll minimize repair expenses. If your heating system is 25 years old or more, you can probably anticipate to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's five years old or older.
