<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very handy in gathering details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance.

You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and performance if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
