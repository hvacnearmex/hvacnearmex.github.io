<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I proceeded and purchased this Carrier and I should state it gets the job done quite well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool down the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
