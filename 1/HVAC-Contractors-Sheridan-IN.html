<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find a sincere AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
