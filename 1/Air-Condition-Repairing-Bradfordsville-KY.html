<p>Some illness, like humidifier fever, are related to exposure to toxic substances from microorganisms that can grow in big structure ventilation systems. However, these illness can also be traced to microbes that grow in house heating and cooling humidifiers and systems.

<p>Since they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the area.
