<h3>Heating Systems in Princeton MN</h3>
<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the possibilities are great that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>
