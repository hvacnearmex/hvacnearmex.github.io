<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Clever MO</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in leading condition for the a/c to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which reside inside the house. The technician can examine the ductwork for indications of holes, gaps or excessive dirt if the private parts are in proper order. Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
