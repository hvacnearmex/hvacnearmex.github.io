<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold growth and must be disposed of.

In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
