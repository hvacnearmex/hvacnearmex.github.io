<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
