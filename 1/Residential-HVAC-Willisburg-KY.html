<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works at Willisburg KY?</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install assessment outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
