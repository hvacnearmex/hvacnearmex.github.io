<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. For example, promoting maintenance services to existing customers throughout the slow season can help alleviate the peak season strain on your tech crew, as noted in Cooling, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Service technicians can mostly concentrate on reacting to calls from brand-new consumers, while your established customers stay pleased as their HVAC systems hum along nicely thanks to proactive examinations. The marketing part of your organisation plan for an HVAC company need to include how you'll advertise these kinds of services.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results by means of a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>
