<h3>AC Replacement in Horse Shoe NC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
