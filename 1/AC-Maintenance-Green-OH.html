In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top environmental risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how hazardous lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, pipes, and numerous other items.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires managed by specialists, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
