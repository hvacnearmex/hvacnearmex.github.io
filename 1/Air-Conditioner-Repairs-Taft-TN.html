<h3>Things Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Taft TN HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is poorly aligned or used and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>

<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain.
