<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
