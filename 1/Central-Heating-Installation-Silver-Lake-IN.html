<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Silver Lake IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
