<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and repaired extremely rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs totally by supplying a professional quote with options, without pushing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Sometimes a momentary indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area.
