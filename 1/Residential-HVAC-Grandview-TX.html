<p>Utilize specialists and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated specialists perform better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. Since they're inexpensive, an ethical company doesn't exploit cheap labor chances simply. Economical workmanship is typically substandard craftsmanship, and it never assists a company construct long-term relationships with clients.<p>
