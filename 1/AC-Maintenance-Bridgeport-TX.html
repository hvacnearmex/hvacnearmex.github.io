<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
