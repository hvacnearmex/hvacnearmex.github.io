The efficiency of these gadgets doubts since they just partially remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon entering the house.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
