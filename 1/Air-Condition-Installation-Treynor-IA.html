<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
