Many typical building materials utilized before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the building materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often advised instead.<p>

During high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
