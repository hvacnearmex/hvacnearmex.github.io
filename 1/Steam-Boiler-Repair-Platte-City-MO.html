In an included system like a home, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones until a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings, and family items like air fresheners, release toxins basically continuously. Other sources, associated to activities carried out in the home, release pollutants intermittently.
