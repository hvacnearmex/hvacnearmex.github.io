<p>Examine these three things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
