<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
