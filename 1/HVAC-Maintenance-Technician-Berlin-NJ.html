<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

An excellent general rule is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface area of a flooring warms the lower half of the space, covering inhabitants in heat at a lower total temperature level-- sometimes approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a standard heating unit."
