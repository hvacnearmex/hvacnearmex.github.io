<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company eventually. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
