<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a house heater, you may search for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and effectiveness.

Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
