<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
