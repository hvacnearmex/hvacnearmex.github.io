<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
