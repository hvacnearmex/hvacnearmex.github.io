<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
