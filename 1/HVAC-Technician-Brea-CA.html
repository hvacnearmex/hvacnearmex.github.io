<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Brea CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
