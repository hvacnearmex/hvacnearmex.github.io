<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such details can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping track of data is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs.
