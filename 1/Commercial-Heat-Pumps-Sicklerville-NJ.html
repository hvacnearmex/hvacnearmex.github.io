<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace.
