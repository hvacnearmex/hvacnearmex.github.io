As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>AC Replacement Service in State Farm VA</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these devices is uncertain since they just partly remove the radon decay products and do not decrease the quantity of radon going into the house. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a reputable means of decreasing the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers additional information on air-cleaning devices to minimize indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
