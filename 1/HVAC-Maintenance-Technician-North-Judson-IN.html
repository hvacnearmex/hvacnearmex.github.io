<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

This indicates that cost savings are still understood during the cooler duration. In reality, a desuperheater lowers winter season water heating expenses by approximately half.<p>
