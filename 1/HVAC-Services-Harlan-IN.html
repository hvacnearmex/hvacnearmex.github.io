<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often important to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs.
