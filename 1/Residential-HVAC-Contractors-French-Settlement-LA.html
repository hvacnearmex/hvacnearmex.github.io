<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in French Settlement LA?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
