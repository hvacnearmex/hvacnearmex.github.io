<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
