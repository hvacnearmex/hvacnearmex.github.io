<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually triggered by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of impurities from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the office indoor air examinations it has carried out. Examinations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually discovered the very same to be real. These examinations exposed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not normally consist of lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the house from home pipes that is made with lead products.

Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
