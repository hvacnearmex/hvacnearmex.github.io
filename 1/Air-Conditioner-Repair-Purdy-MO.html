My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
