<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better option. If the present system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
