However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold growth and wetness inside is associated with a greater frequency of occupant breathing problems.<p>
