These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for.

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
