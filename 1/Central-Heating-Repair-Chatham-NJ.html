<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
