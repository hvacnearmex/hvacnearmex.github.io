<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs entirely by supplying a professional quote with options, without pushing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
