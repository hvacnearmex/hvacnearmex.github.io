<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
