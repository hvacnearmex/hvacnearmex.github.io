<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
