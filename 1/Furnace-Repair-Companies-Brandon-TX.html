<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
