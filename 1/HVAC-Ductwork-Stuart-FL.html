<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
