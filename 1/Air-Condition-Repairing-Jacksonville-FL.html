<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue.
