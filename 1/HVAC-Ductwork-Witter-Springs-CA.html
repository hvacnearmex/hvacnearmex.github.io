<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Witter Springs CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
