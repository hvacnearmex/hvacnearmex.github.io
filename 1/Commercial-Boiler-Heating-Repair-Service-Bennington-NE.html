<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Business in Los Angeles.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Unclean filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By contrast, examining and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an abnormally high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had found the problem area in looking over the bill. He dealt with the concern in one day, had actually changed the bill to what I considered fair before he called back, understood what might have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not happen once again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have actually utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
