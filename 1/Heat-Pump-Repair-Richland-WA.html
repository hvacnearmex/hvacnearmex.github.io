Load determining is referred to as the Manual J calculation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Just like determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of system for your home also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Richland WA</h3>

Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
