Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

Just be concerned if your house is not warming up. However, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you should contact a specialist to repair the system and inspect.<p>
