<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
