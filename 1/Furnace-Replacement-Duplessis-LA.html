<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers exposure to contaminants during cooking. Incorrect adjustment, often suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you acquire a new gas stove or range, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
