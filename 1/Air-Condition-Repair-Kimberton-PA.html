<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
