<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally greater than numerous heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the design you acquire. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating options. This implies it can heat up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
