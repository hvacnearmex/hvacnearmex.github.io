<h3>Boiler Installation in Underwood ND</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they detected the issue and repaired very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
