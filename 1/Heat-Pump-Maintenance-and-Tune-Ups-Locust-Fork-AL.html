<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
