<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost.
