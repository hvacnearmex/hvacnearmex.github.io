Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
