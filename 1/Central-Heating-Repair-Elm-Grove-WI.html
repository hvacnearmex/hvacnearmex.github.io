A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house.

<p>Measurement treatments are being established and demonstrated to examine building ventilation and indoor pollutant concentrations. These treatments vary from sophisticated tracer gas approaches used primarily in building research efforts to less involved procedures that can be utilized by constructing operators. NIST researchers are continuously developing new test treatments, and after that demonstrating them in the field to assess their feasibility and dependability. The efforts in which these treatments are shown in the field has actually led to the advancement of a crucial database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
