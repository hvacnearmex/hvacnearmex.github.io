<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Dateland AZ</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the concern and repaired really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
