Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
