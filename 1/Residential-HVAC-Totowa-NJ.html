<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure."

If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
