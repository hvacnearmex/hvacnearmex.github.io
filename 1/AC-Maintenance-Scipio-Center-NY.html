Initially, you'll need one that is properly sized for your house.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
