<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
