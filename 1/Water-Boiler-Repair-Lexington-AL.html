If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While space cooling offers optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
