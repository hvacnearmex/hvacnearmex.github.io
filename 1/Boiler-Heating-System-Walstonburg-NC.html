<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as gas, oil, or coal. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth. Additionally, a geothermal cooling and heating system utilizes substantially less electricity compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an appealing option to cut your carbon footprint, providing a favorable effect on the environment.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater is more trusted than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reputable and readily available source of energy.<p>
