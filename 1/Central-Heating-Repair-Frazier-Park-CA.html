<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might observe moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
