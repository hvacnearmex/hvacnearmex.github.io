Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
