<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Murfreesboro TN</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
