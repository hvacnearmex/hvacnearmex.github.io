<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
