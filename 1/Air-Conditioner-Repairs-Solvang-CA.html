<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Great Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed issues. I would recommend this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
