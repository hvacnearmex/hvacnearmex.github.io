<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Syracuse IN?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>If you see a decline in heat output, first ensure the air filter is clean and in good condition. Next, check other elements of the furnace for any build-up of debris, dust and dirt, an economical repair that can help boost efficiency. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage. Finally, ensure the thermostat is working and positioned properly. Try moving it far from direct sunshine since this may impact temperature readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your home. If this occurs, your thermostat will shut off the furnace prematurely and leave your house feeling cold. You might likewise need to check your insulation to make certain that warm air does not get away from your space through different openings.<p>
