<p>A regular furnace tune up can go a long way towards minimizing a lot of the issues caused by build-up of dirt and particles, and the inspections allow your contractor to keep an eye on longer-term problems and take proactive steps to assist prevent premature failure or troublesome breakdowns during the heating season. Yearly furnace service may likewise be a requirement to keep your furnace service warranty valid as well. Many manufacturers state on warranty documentation that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC provider belong of the guarantee conditions. When you have a ten-year parts limited service warranty as is basic on Carrier Â® furnaces, you'll want to make certain you keep that protection valid for the full 10 years.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
