<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company should check measurements of air, humidity and temperature flow. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for developing usage and occupancy) must be carried out. A building walk-through to check for odors and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or pest droppings might be handy. Leaks need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofs and in boiler pans can become polluted with bacteria or fungis and need to be eliminated, likewise. In some circumstances, specific screening for radon or for asbestos may be needed as part of structure occupancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
