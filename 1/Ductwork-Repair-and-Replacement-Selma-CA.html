<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
