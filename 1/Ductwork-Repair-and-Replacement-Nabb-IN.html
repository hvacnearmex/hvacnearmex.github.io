<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills suddenly appear greater than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system. New heating equipment is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel costs right away, not to discuss the cash you'll minimize repair costs.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated performance benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
