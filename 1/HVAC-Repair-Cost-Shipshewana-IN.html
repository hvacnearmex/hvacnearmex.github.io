<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>For most indoor air quality issues in the home, source control is the most reliable solution. This area takes a source-by-source look at the most common indoor air contaminants, their possible health effects, and ways to lower levels in the home. (For a summary of the points made in this area, see the area entitled "Referral Guide to Major Indoor Air Pollutants in the House.") EPA has just recently launched, Ozone Generators That Are Offered As Air Cleaners The purpose of this file (which is only available through this web site) is to offer precise info relating to using ozone-generating devices in indoor occupied areas. This info is based on the most reliable scientific evidence presently offered.<p>
