<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off.

Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
