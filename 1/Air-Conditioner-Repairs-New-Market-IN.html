<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one action mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repetitive use of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.. a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
