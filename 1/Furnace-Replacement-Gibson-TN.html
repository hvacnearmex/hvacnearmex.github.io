<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis.

Soil by roads and highways might be infected from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before entering the house. Alter your clothing before you go house and wash these clothes separately if you work with lead in your job or a hobby. Motivate your children to play in sand and grassy areas rather of dirt which sticks to toys and fingers. Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and ensure they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>
