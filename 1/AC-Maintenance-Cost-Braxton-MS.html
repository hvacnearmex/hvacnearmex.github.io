<p>A health survey should be developed and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool needs to identify the number of individuals affected; define ages and task descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they are located within the office; suggest when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of specific health signs or health problems; determine all makers operated in the workplace; show the kind of outside air contamination; and identify potential sources of task tension.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
