When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper.

When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy.
