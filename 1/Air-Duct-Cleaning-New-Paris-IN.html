<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins flowing through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the result of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too little or too much air blood circulation. Workplace temperature levels need to be maintained between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%.

A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may enter close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
