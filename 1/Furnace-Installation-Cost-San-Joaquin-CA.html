This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
