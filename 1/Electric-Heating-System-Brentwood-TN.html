<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two must not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the form of electricity. The 2 operations use different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
