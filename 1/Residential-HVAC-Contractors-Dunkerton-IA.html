<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
