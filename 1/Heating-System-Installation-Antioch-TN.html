<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might see unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
