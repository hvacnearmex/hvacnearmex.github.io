<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Avenel NJ</h3>
<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature of the flooring.

They are accountable for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to.

Review of this data may identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
