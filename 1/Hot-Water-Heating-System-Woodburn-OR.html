<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
