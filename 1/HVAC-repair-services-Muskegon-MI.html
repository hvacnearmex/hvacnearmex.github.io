There are many different locations a blockage can happen. Among the main locations where clogs begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

Such aspects include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide gas emitted by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls consisted of in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
