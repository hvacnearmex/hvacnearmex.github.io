Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
