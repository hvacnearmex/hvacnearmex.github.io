Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week!

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
