<p>We take a look at clues prior to we supply guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and performance if you already have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
