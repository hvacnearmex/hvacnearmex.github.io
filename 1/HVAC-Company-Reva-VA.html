<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
