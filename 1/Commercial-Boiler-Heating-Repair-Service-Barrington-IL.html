Insufficient ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or put in such a way that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building residents. Poorly situated outside air intake vents can also generate air polluted with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.
