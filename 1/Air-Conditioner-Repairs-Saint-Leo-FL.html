<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively.
