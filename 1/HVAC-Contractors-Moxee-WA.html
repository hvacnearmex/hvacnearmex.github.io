<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective approaches of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be heated up in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered just a few feet listed below ground. In the summer season, the process reverses, consequently cooling a home by eliminating heat. Underground temperature level remains constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems supply reliable and constant heating and cooling.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates. Experts advise utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and generally are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
