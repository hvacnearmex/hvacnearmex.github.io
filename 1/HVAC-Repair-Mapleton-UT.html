<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofs.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
