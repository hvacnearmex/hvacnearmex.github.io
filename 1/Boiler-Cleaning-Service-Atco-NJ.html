<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Service! Climate Pro is reliable and genuinely cared about us and our situation. We got back one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might look for and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most incredible was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right prior to a vacation, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my friends.<p>

Local building codes likely define the amount (and often quality) of outside air that must be continually provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA).
