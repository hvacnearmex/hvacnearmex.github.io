<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air toxin arising from natural gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
