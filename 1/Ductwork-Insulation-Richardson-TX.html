<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in gathering details on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Due to the fact that it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you know it remains in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers moderate results that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These signs include headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, disorientation and tiredness. The effects of CO exposure can vary considerably from person to person depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
