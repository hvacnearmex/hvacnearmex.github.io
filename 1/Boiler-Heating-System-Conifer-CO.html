<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
