<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Services in Corsicana</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations develop indoors, exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>

Permeable products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic.
