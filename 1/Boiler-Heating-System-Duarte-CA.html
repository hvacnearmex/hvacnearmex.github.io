<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>

Packaged a/c unit often include electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace.
