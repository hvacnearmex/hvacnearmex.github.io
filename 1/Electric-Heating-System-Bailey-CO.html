The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.
