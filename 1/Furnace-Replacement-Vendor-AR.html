With this acquisition, Pueblo expanded its capabilities, allowing an enhanced value proposal for a wider set of customers.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
