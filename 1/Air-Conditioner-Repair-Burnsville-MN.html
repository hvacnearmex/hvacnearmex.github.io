<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
