<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
