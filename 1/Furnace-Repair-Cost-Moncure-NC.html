<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are very efficient, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a consistent temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
