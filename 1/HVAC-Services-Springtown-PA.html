<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
