Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater.
