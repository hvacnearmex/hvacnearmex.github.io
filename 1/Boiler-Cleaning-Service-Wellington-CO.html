<p>Expert heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals suggest following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase new.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
