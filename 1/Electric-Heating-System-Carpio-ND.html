<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
