<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Illness (BRI) refers to less frequent (but typically more severe) cases of individuals ending up being ill after being in a particular structure at a particular time. In these cases, there is typically a comparable set of clinical signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can often be discovered upon investigation. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by bacteria which can infect a structure's air conditioning system.<p>

<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). However, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores.

More severe than many allergenic homes is the ability of mold to activate episodes personallies that currently have asthma, a serious breathing disease.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>Whether your a/c unit has actually stopped blowing cool air or it makes strange sounds, call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric for a professional inspection.
