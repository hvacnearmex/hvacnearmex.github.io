He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have actually fulfilled in a very long time.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
