The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to decipher.<p>
