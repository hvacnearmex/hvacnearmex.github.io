This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
