<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
