<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and work environments matters, especially because we spend most of our lives inside your home. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses electrical energy, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces.

More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
