<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
