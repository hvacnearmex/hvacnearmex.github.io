The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and assists tire them from the home.<p>

<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins flowing through your system.
