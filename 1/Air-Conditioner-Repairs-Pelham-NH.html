<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers in Pelham NH</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
