<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and treat-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
