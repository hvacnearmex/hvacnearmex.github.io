<p>The very first a/c and refrigerators employed poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Asthmatic children are especially at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
