<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that perfect temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.
