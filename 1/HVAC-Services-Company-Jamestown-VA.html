<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
