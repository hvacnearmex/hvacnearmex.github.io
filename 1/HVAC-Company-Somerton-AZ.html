<p>A health questionnaire must be developed and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool must identify the number of people impacted; define ages and task descriptions of involved employees; determine where they lie within the workplace; suggest when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of specific health signs or health problems; determine all machines run in the office; suggest the type of outdoors air contamination; and identify potential sources of task tension.<p>
<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heater. Low-efficiency models will cost less, however lead to higher energy expenses. High-efficiency models cost more, but save more over the long run. Prices for gas heaters range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models up to $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric furnaces begin at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending on the brand and furnace size.<p>

However more intricate problems-- identified by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, among the 3 strategies listed below might be appropriate.<p>
