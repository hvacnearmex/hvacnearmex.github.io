Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we fixed issues. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.
