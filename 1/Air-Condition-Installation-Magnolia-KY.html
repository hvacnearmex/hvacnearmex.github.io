<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
