<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>

Some of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers).
