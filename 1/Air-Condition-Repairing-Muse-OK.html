If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones got.

ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install assessment outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
