<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might notice moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>

The structure type included both residential and commercial. Most of samples analyzed were evaluated favorable for germs and fungis.<p>
