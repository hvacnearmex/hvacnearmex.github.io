<p>Structures are developed or intended to respond actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and preserve surfaces to improve their longevity, appearance, or efficiency. In other cases, such modifications subtly or perhaps significantly modify buildings in ways that may be important to their own stability or their effect on structure residents through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time.
