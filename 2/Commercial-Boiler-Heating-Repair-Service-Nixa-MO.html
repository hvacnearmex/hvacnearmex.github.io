An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
