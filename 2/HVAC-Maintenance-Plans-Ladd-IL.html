<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
