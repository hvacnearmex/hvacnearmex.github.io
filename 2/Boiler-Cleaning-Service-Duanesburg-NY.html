<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
