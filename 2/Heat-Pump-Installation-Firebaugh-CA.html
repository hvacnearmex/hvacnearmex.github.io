<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
