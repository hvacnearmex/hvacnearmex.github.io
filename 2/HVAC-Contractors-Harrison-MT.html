<p>Usually the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.

Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
