<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
