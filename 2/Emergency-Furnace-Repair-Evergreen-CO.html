<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can usually be performed in just a few minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
