<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
