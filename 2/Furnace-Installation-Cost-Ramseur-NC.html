The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
