<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
