<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
