<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>

<p>My eldest kid always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before.
