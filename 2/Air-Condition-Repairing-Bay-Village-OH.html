Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might search for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated home once again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right before a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my friends.<p>
