<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't position the condenser under a deck or totally confine it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow limitation will reduce the unit's performance.

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
