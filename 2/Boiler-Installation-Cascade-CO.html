<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Numerous typical building products used before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Generally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation.

<h3>Ductless Heat Pump in Cascade CO</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>A/c service visits cover a long list of checks in, on and around your devices. B & B Heating & Cooling experts will have a look at things that might be making your AC work inefficiently, such as refrigerant charge.

<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Cascade CO?</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Solar Heating System in Cascade CO</h3>
<p>Ensure there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not just will obstructed vents and signs up affect your comfort, they can also cause duct leakages due to excessive atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT a great idea. You will not save any additional money and will wind up causing more problems for your heating system.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit sincere, responsive and enjoyable. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our options prior to our work with Brian and was amazing, valuable and informative - his work was impeccable! All of his assistants were conscientious and polite. The work site was left entirely cleared and cleaned. We would highly motivate others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Cooling for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do determine a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating system and pick to install it in your house, you could be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs. (And these expenses can be substantial.

Consult the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax deductions readily available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating system where you live.<p>
