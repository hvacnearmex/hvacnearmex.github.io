<p>A specialized a/c unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic ac system because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
