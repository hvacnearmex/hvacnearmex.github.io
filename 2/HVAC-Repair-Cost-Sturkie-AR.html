<h3>Cheap AC Units in Sturkie AR</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
