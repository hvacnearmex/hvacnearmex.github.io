<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
