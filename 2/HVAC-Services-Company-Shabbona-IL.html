<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
