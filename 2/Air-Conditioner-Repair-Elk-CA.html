<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of advantages to utilizing a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heating unit. Radiant heating systems tend to be far more energy efficient than other heaters, for one thing. Forced air heating unit tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of up to 30% of their output. Forced air heater also tend to generate cold and hot areas throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>

However, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors.
