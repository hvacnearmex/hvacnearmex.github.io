<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>I extremely suggest utilizing this service. Really reliable extremely nice. Looked after a part that was not covered under guarantee quickly and effective and did not need to pay an arm and a leg to get it done. Great company begun by a guy who is looking to grow his business and secure his household. He set up a complete system inside and out. Excellent unit and a very good cost. I am presently on the maintance plan. He takes care of it twice a year with out having to be reminded to do it.<p>
