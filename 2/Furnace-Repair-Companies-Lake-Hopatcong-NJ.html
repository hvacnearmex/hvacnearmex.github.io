<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year.
