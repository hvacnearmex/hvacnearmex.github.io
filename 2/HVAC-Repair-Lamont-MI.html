<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is normally greater than numerous heat pump options, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the model you purchase. One of the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating options. This implies it can warm up your house to the wanted temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
