<h3>Boiler Cleaning Service in Apex NC</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
