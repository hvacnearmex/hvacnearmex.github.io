<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health impacts pointed out.

A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components.

<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Polluted central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
