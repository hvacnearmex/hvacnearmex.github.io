<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>The heat pump got popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can draw out heat from different sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heatpump move heat from outside the structure into the air within. At first, heat pump HVAC systems were just used in moderate environments, however with improvements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in appeal in cooler environments.<p>
<p>Because they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
