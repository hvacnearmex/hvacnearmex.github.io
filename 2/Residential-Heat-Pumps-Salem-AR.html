<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them.. Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
