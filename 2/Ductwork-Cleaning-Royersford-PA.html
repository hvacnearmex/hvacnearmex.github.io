<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
