<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating system, you might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
