<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Wallsburg UT</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require relatively little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is essential to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be looked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be examined a minimum of two times annually for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to remove dust collected in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
