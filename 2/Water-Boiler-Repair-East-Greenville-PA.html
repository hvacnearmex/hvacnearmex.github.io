<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services in East Greenville PA</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>

Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
