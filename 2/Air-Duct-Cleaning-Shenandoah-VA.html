<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
