<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside your home.
