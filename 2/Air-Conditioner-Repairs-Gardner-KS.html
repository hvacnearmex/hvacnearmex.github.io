<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Gardner KS</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is important to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leaks, the system must be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems should be inspected a minimum of twice annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
