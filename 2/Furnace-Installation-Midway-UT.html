That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air course. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
