<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
