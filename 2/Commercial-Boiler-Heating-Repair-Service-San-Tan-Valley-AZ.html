<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
