<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do decline them up until they have been properly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
