<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
