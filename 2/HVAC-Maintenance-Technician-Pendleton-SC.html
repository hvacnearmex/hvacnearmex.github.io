<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad.

As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
