<p>At present, EPA does not recommend utilizing air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain due to the fact that they only partly eliminate the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon entering the house. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a reputable means of decreasing the health danger from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides more details on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
