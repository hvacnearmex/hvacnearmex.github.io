My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>

For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
