Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
