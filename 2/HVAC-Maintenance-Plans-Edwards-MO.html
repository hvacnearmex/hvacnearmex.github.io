<p>Many well and city water does not normally contain lead. Water generally gets lead inside the house from family plumbing that is made with lead products.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
