<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractor in Forest Falls</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
