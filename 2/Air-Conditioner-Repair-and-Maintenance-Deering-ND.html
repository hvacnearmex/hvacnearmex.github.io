<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
