<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
