<p>Its special feature is the existence of one main external system that linked to several indoor units. Such systems might be the ideal service for keeping the microclimate in a number of offices, stores, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor systems do not worsen the visual look of the structure. The main external unit can be connected to a number of various indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, and so on<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
