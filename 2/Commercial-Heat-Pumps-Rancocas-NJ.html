<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
