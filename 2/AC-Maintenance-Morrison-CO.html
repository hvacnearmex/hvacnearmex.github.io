<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to start (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan must spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins however the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
