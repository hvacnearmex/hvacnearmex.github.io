Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside.
