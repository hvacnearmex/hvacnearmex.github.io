<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.
