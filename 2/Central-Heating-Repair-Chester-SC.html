<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
