Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
