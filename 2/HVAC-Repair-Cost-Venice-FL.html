<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, considering that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
