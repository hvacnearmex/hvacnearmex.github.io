<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less effective.
