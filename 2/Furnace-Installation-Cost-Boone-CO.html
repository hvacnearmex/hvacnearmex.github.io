<p>We're investing a lot more time inside, these days. While many individuals assume contamination is just an outdoor issue, your house (and workplace) can likewise be polluted. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not believe enough about direct exposure to all the important things we place in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right away, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
