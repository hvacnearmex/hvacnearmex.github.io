<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
