Incorrect adjustment, often indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue.

Never utilize a gas stove to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
