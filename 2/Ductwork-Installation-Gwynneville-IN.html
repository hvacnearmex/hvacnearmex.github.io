No matter what the type of house HVAC system, adequate air flow (ventilation), correct filtering, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running safely and not adding to or causing an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers direct exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Incorrect adjustment, often indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. If you buy a brand-new gas stove or range, consider buying one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never utilize a gas stove to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
