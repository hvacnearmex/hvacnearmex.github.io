<p>When setting up the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one included excavation, running numerous backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is quite expensive. Installing a brand-new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
