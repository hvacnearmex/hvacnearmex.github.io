<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise houses bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family home installation company totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many people.<p>
