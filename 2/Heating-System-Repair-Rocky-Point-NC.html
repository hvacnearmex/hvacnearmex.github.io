<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
