There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
