<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
