<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should look out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
