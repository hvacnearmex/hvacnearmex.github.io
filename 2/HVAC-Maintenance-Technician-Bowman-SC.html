<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
