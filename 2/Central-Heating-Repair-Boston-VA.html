<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat.

A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
