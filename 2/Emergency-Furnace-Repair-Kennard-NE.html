<p>Buildings are designed or planned to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and maintain surfaces to enhance their durability, look, or performance. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or even drastically alter buildings in ways that may be very important to their own stability or their effect on structure residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time.
