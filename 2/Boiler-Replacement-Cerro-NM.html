<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them till they have actually been appropriately dried.
