<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
