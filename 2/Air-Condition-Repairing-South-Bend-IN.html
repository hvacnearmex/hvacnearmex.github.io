<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>

<p>The types of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as different as the various houses they serve (single household homes, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condos, row real estate, and so on).

Such elements consist of using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas given off by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
