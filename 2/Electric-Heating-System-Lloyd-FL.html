<p>A specific a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path. A basic ac system transfers heat energy out of the space because its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
