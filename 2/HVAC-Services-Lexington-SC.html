<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to assess scenario & decided to choose them for the work. I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were really expert, polite and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's type of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one aspect (out of numerous) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>To begin, it's a great concept to consider energy effectiveness.
