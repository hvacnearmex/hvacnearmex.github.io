<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in Georgetown IN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses.
