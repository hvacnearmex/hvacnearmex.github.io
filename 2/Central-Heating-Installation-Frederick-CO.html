<h3>Electric Boiler Repair in Frederick CO</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the visit. They advised changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
