<h3>Heating Duct in Virgin UT</h3>
<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE rankings often come with higher cost. So, make sure to decide based upon how frequently you will utilize your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For most temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter season, having an incredibly high rated heating system is not always essential.<p>
