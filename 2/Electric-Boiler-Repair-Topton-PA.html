<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Topton PA</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a series of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, nausea, disorientation, and confusion, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in individuals with persistent cardiovascular disease. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are in some cases confused with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, elderly people, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing disease can be specifically sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures.<p>
