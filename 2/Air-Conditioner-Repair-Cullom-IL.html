Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other kinds of heat pumps, have performances rated according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE.
