A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is frequently recommended instead.<p>

<p>Many well and city water does not normally include lead. Water generally gets lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead products. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water evaluated.

<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air pollutant resulting from gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Often a momentary indoor air quality issue is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complex problems-- determined by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below might be suitable.<p>
