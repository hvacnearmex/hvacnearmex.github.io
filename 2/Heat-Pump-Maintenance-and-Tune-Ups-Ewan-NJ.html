<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

It has also been shown to cause cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
