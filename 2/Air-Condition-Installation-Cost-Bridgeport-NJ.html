<h3>HVAC Service in Bridgeport NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
