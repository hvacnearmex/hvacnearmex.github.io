<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same).

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
