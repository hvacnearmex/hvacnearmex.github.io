<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
