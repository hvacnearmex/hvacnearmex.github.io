<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outside metal cabinet consists of the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator. In numerous split-system air conditioning system, this indoor cabinet also includes a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump. The air conditioner's evaporator coil is installed in the cabinet or main supply duct of this furnace or heatpump. A split-system is the most economical central air conditioner to install if your house already has a furnace but no air conditioner.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
