<h3>Air Condition Service in Wildwood NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better solution.
