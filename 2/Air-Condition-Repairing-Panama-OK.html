<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
