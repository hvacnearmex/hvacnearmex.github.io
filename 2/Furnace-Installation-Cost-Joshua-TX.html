<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>

A little house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
