<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Cedar Brook NJ</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
