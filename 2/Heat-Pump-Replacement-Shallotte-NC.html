<p>The compressor can shut and get too hot down if the condenser coils are obstructed. You'll experience periodic periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Shut off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales guy concerns your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the choices for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
