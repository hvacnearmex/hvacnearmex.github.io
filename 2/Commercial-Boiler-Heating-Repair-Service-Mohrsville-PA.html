<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
