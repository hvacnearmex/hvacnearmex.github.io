<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>

<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
