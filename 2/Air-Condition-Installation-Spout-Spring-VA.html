<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Think about prospective effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the producer's directions, specifically directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
