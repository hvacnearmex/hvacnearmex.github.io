<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke causes nose, throat, and eye inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
