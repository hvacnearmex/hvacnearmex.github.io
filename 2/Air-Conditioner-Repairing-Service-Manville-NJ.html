<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Structures continuously progress as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them as well as the residents, products, and activities within them. The numerous surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously connecting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing somewhat with time as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become obstructed with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
