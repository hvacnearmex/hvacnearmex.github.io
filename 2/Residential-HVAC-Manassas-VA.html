<p>Appropriate ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, till the required for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production.

<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in sufficient amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or positioned in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Incorrectly situated outdoor air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
