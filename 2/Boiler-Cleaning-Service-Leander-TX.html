<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>

While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
