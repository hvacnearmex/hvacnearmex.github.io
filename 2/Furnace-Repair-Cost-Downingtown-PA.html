<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
