<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and structure residents might be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace machines, cleaning items, building carpets, home furnishings and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside toxins.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
