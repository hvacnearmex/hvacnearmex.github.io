<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When going over alternatives for HVAC replacement, Bryant air conditioning brand is another fantastic brand name that requires to be considered. Bryant is a well recognized brand name that offers AC units, heatpump, and gas furnaces. It is fairly priced and is a sister company to some of the other top brand names on our list. Bryant a/c are typically made with the same quality parts as a Provider brand HVAC system. If you were wishing to set up a mid tier AC replacement with a 14 SEER Bryant Preferred 124ANS air conditioner, it would cost around $2,624 in installation expenses.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months before the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
