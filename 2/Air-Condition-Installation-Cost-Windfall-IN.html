<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have managed the one repair I required well, and are expert and constantly on-time. Have been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been great.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
