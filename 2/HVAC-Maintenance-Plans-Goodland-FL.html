<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
