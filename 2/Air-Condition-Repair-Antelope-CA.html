<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal components also. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms at once, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
