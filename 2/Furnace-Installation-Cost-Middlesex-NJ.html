<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
