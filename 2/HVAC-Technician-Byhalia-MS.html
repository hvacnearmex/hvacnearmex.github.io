<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others.

Furnaces that kick on frequently may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
