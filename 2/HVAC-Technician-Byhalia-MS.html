<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use.

Furnaces that kick on frequently may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
