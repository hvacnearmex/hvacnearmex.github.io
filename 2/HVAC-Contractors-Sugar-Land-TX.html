<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
