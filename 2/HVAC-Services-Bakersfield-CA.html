<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Bakersfield CA</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
