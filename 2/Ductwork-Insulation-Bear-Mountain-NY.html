<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage. They use a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the area. The bigger the space, the more powerful the house heating unit needs to be. For currently built home heating unit, the contractor will need to get rid of the old furnace to add the brand-new one. These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
