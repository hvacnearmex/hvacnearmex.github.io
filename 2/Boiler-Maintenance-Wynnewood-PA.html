<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
