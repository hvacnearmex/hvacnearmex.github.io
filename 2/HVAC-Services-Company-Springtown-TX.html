<h3>Air Condition Installation Near Me in Springtown TX</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
