<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

Exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings construct up inside your home.<p>

Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and offered source of energy.<p>
