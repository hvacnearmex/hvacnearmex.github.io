The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
