<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Lansing KS</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
