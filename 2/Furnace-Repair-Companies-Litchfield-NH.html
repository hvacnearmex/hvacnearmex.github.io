<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Litchfield NH</h3>
<p>From rewiring old knob-and-tube systems to dealing with furnace and AC installations, the Seattle electricians and plumbing professionals at Seatown have you covered.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
