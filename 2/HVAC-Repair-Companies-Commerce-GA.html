<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down quickly.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
