<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices maker's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one action stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided.

For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a very advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
