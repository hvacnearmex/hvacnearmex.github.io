<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.
