<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally brought on by the absence of appropriate ventilation, which results in a buildup of impurities from sources in the house.

These examinations exposed that correct ventilation is very important in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>

According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
