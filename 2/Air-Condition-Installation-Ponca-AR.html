<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold development and must be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Repair the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
