<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>

Another repair sign is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be actually cold on a below absolutely no night.<p>
