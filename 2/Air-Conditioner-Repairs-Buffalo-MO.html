<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
