<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>

No two systems are precisely the exact same, however filter modifications are something we provide throughout PM check outs if the client requires it- specifically the inaccessible filters- since we know how important it is that they be changed out & how hard it can be for a property owner to do it.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins. If  it does not, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Sean was very handy. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
