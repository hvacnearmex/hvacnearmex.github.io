<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires handled by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
