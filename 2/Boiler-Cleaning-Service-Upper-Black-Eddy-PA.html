<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results via a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to analyze.<p>
