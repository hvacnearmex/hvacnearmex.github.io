<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
