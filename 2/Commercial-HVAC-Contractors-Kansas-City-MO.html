<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing integrates quality products and impressive service with development and technological advances to provide high-performance cooling and heating products worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external system. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioning unit there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting numerous traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor units located in the space.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with debris that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be done in just a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
