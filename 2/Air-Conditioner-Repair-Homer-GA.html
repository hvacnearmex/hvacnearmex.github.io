<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
