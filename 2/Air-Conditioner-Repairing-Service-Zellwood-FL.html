<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
