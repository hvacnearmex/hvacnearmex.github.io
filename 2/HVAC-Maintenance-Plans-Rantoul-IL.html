Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider.
