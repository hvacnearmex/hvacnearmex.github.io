<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
