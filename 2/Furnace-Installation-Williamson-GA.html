<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
