<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
