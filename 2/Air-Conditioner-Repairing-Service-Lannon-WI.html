<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as developing products, home furnishings, and home items like air fresheners, release contaminants more or less constantly.
