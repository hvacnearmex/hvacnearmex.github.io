<p>Indoor air contamination is caused by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is fairly complicated and can vary significantly from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance task may need completely different steps and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being examined. Installations can likewise vary significantly, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. In some cases, totally new ductwork may require to be installed in a structure that had none prior to.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to install, especially if you make it part of a build or remodelling project.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Radiant heating systems can likewise heat spaces with less energy spent, and keep them heated for longer, given that many floors tend to keep heat much better than air does.<p>
