<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
