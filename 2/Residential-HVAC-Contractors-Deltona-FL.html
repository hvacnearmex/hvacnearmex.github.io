<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure fact that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will typically build up in ductwork, limiting airflow. Because ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear extremely difficult at first, needing specialized tools, equipment, and know-how. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
