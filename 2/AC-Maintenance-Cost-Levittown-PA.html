<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
