<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and harden-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>

The structure type consisted of both commercial and residential. Most of samples examined were tested favorable for fungis and germs.<p>
