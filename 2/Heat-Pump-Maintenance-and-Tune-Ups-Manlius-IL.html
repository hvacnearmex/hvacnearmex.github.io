<p>The most common type of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least pricey alternative, however more recent systems can be very energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems normally achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly efficient gas furnaces can accomplish AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
