<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for house owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
