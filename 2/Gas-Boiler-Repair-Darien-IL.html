<p>Sean was really useful. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
