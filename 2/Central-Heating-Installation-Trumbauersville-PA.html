<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
