<p>Air contaminants can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin resulting from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is frequently essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can sometimes be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping track of information is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this data may determine possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
