<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
