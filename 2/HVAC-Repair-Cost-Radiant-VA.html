The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
