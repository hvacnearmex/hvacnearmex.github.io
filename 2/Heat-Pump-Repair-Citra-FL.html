<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
