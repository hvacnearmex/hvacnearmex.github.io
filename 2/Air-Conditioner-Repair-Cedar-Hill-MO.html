<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. Many home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
