<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family home installation service totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
