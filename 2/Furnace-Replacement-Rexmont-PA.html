<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
