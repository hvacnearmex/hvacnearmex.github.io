<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heating system, you may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
