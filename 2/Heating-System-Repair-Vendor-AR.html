<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up regularly, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be done in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools needed.

<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of unusual being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large industrial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and healthcare facilities, cars such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, planes and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which typically consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Your furnace is a financial investment; if treated right, it might heat your home for several years without issues. If left disregarded, a furnace is prone to breakdowns, performance concerns, and catastrophic failures, which might lead to severe emergency situations. Our local furnace maintenance professionals are ready to provide your furnace with the attention it requires to last for years to come.
