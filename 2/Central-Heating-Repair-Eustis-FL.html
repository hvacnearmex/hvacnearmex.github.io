<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
