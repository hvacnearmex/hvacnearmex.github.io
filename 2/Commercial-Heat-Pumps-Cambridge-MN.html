<p>If you have a large house, a house with high ceilings, a house with many windows or a house with insufficient insulation, heating your floorings rather than the air may not suffice to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed. Property owners would be well advised to perform a house energy audit to examine where improvements might be made to increase the efficiency of an existing HVAC system. These modifications could in fact accumulate and potentially reduce your viewed need for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>Furthermore, house owners have a variety of alternatives to choose from in powering a flooring heating unit. Glowing systems work with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.

If the marketplace for that energy source turns unpredictable, rates can change, rates spike and you can end up paying more to heat your house despite how low you set your thermostat.<p>
