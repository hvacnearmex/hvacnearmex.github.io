<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure.

The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenditures.
