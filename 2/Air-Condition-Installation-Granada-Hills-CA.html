<p>Area Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans must be set up in all restrooms and kitchens. These fans get rid of humidity and carbon monoxide. The most reliable fans are long lasting and quiet. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to ensure the fans run for an enough time period. An excellent general rule is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they must be put. Many typically they are installed at height-level or a little lower, if people primarily remain seated in that particular area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensing unit accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the highest concentrations inside structures are typically near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
