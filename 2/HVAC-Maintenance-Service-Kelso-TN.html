<h3>Air Condition Installation in Kelso TN</h3>
<p>It's not advised for uncertified individuals to repair & inspect air conditioning & HVAC devices. There is a risk of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. It would be best if you left it to an experienced ac repair Houston Midtown tech for appropriate HVAC diagnosis. Always make sure when checking your air conditioning devices to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch. Be very careful when examining capacitors, even with the a/c system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power turned off. An unexpected discharge from an a/c capacitor can cause extreme injury or death.<p>
<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved problems. I would advise this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
