<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and cure-- generally 2 to four weeks.
