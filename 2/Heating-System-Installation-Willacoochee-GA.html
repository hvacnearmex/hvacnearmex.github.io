<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Willacoochee GA</h3>
<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological impurities are moist or wet building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness brought on by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are family pets and home plants.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in cars in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
