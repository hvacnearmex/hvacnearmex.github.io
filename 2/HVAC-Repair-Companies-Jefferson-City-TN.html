<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is normally used in a third-floor or 2nd area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
