<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to examine and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more reliable option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>A Trane air conditioning unit can vary in rate from $4,000 - $10,000. Our rates guide explains all the elements that impact your rate. The cost of your air conditioner will differ depending on the size of your house, design you choose, unique installation requirements - even where you live and the climate in your location. You can decrease your costs thanks to local rebates, special offers and tax credits To get the most precise rate for your home, schedule a house evaluation with your local dealer.<p>
