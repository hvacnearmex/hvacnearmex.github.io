They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
