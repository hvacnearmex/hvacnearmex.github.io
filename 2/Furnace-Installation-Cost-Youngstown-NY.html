<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
