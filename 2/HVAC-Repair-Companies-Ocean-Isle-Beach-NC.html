<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
