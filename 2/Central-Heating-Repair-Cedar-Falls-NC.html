<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
