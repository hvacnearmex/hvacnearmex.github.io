Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

<p>Central air units are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
