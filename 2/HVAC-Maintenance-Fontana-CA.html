<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.
