<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent.
