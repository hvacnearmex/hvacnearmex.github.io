<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Bedford NH</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants discharged by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high indoors might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as constructing products, home furnishings, and household products like air fresheners, release contaminants more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities carried out in the home, release toxins periodically. These include smoking, the use of malfunction-ing or unvented stoves, heating systems, or space heaters, making use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, using paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and using cleaning items and pesticides in house cleaning. High toxin concentrations can stay in the air for extended periods after some of these activities.<p>
