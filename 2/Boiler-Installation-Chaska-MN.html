<p>All modern a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth doesn't necessarily translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company.
