<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
