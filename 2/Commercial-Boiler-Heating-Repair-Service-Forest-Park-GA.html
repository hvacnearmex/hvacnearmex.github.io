<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Forest Park GA</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to assess situation & decided to choose them for the work. I more than happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked to from beginning to end were extremely expert, courteous and the work was very efficiently done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>

<p>Air contaminants can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from gas that gets away into your house without being burned off. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are normally greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
