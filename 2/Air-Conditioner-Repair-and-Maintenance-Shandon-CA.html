<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
