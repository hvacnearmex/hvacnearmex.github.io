<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, people exhale carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not toxic, but may become harmful if high concentrations are permitted to collect.

If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread out throughout the whole office or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
