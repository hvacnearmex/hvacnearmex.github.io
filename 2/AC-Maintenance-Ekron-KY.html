<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and health centers, automobiles such as cars and trucks, trains, planes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with regard to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>A third way to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can suggest your home might not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To find odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
