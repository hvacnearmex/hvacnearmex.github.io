<p>While toxin levels from private sources may not pose a substantial health risk by themselves, the majority of houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that many people can take both to decrease the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to act that can lower the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>We recommend annual preventative Maintenance for your heating and cooling systems.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
