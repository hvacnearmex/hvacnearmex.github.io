<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
