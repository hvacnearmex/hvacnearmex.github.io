<h3>Things to Look for When Hiring an Knifley KY HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more severe with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are commonly installed in tandem with a more standard form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
