<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
