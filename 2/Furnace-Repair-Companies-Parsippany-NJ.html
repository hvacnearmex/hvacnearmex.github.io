<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats.

In this case, the control system is extremely critical to keeping a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building codes likely specify the amount (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that must be continuously provided in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation paired with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
