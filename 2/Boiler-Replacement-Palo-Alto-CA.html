<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor begins but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Turn off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
