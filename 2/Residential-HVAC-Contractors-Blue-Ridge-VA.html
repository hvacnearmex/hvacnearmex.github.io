<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Blue Ridge VA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up evaluation results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
