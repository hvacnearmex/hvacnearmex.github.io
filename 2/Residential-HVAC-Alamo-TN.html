<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
