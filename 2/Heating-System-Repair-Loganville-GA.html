<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
