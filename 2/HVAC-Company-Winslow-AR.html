<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or wet building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and ac system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease caused by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Numerous fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the structure residents. Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and household plants.<p>
