<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Numerous disconnect blocks include 2 cartridge fuses. Inspect them before you proceed with repairs (Picture 3). A blown fuse is a sign of a failing part inside the condensing system. So don't just change it and believe you have actually fixed the problem. Instead, change the parts we show here. Then set up brand-new merges and fire up the system. Call a pro-- you've got more major concerns if it blows again.<p>
