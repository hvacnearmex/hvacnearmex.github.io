Other research shows that individuals spend approximately 90 percent of their time inside your home. Thus, for lots of people, the threats to health might be higher due to exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll save money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as standard air-source units. The lack of moving parts means you're less most likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
