<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>Cooling and refrigeration are supplied through the elimination of heat. Heat can be eliminated through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as refrigerants A refrigerant is employed either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is utilized to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a totally free cooling system which uses pumps to distribute a cool refrigerant (usually water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE rankings frequently include higher cost. So, make sure to decide based on how often you will utilize your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year.
