<h3>Furnace Service in Walls MS</h3>

This is a really common repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensor replaced as preventative maintenance due to the fact that the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
