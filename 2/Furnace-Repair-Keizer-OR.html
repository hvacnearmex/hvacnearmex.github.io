<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
