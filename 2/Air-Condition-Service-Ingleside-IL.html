<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Ingleside IL</h3>
<p>Most people are aware that outside air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can also have significant, damaging effect. EPA research studies of human exposure to air contaminants indicate that indoor levels of toxins may be two to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers consistently rank indoor air contamination among the top 5 ecological health threats to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
