<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and cure-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
