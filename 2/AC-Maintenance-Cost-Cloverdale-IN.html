When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down rapidly. This is a really common repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having actually other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensing unit changed as preventative maintenance due to the fact that the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
