<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
