<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
