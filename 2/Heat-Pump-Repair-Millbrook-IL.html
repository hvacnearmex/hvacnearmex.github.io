<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center. But a lot of the important things individuals do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their houses and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
