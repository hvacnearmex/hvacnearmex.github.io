<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're closed down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the result of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation. Workplace temperature levels ought to be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by excessive air flow need to be avoided.<p>
