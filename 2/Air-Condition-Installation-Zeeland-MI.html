The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
