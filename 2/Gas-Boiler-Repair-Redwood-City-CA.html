<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..

So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
