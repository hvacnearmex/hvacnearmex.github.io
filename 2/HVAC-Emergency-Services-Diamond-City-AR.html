"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done.

The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
