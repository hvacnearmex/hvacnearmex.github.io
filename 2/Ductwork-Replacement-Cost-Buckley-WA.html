<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, considering that it is secured inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.

For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat allergen might cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
