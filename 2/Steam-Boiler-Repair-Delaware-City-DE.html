<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors.

Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
