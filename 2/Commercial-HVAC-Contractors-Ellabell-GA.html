<p>I have actually been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again.
