<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.
