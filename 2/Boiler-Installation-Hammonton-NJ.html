<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
