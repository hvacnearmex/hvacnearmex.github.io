<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Kennett Square PA</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode".

This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
