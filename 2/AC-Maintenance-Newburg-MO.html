<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms.
