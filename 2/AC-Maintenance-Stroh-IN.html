Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%.

<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not impacted by any external aspects, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a trustworthy and available source of energy.<p>
