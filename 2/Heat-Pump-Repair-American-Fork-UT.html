<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up assessment results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
