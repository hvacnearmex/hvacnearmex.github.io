<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
