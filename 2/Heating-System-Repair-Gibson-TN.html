<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this enter the backyards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal components too. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms simultaneously, however are not very energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
