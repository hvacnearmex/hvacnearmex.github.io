<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the outcome of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and insufficient or excessive air flow. Work environment temperature levels should be kept between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation ought to be prevented.<p>
