<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can normally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed.
