We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency benefit. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions since they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
