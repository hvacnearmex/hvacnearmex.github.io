<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions since they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
