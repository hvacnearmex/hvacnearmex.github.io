<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
