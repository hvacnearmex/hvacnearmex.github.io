There are several design approaches in use today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with comparable concepts. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>

The best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the same quantity of cooling.<p>
