<p>Your Review This is my third time utilizing All the time. Ilan always makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these devices). I have absolutely nothing however great things to state - he has taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick response - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
