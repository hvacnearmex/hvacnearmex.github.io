<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Ashton IL</h3>
<p>There are many reasons that this can take place. The bright side is that you can address a number of these factors by yourself without the requirement to call for professional help.

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel.

To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
