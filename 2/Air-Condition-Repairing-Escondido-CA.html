The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time.
