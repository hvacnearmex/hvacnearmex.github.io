<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Westmont IL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and understand the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
