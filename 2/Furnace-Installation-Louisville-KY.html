<h3>HVAC Contractors Near Me in Louisville KY</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
