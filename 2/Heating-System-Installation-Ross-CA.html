Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI caused by germs which can infect a structure's air conditioning system.<p>
<p>A/c unit makers generally make rugged, high quality items. If your air conditioning system fails, begin by checking any merges or breaker. Let the system cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
