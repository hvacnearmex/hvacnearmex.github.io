Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
