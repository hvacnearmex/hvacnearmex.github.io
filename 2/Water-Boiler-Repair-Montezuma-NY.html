Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2).

<h3>The Way to Eradicate Boiler Issues in Montezuma NY</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction.
