<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
