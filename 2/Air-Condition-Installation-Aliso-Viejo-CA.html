<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Right Furnace Repair in Aliso Viejo CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
