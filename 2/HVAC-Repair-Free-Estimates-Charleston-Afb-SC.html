He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
