<p>Many people will need a new heating system eventually. Even the best devices eventually stops working or technology advances so far as to make using older heating units too expensive.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash can be found in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
