<p>All heating unit have some level of air purification. From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the skills or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and performance if you already have a house heating system.

The bright side is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
