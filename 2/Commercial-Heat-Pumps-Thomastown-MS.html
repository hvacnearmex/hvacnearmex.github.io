<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
