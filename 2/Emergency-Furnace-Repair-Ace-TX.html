<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.
