<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Coldwater OH?</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "general responsibility stipulation" applies. This provision, typical to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, states that an employer should supply a healthy and safe workplace. Therefore, making sure the air is of great quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
