<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the launched spores.

More serious than a lot of allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a major breathing disease.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>A geothermal desuperheater is extremely effective and helpful, particularly during the Summer while the system acts to cool one's home. This is since the excess heat taken in from within the house is conducted into the hot water tank rather than being sent back into the earth. The result, for that reason, is totally free warm water! Furthermore, during winter season, the heat from underground can be absorbed to heat domestic water together with its primary purpose of offering space heating. This suggests that cost savings are still understood throughout the chillier period. In truth, a desuperheater minimizes winter water heating costs by approximately 50 percent.<p>
