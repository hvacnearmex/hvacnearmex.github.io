The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room.

<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., office devices; flooring, wall and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
