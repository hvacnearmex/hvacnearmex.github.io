<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Garland TX</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is much more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
