<p>Airflow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
