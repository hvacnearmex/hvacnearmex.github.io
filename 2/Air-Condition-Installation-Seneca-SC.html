<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces in Seneca SC</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home building is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floors. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
