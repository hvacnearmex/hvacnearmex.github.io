<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leakages, merely adding refrigerant is not a service. A qualified technician needs to fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant.

Refrigerant leakages can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
