<h3>Installation of HVAC in Churubusco IN</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm delighted I found Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this key in the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements too. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous spaces at the same time, but are not very energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might invest more money on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
