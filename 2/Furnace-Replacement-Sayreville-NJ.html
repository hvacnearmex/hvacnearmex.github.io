Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>The first ac system and fridges utilized poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
