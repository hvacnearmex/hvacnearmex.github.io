<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
