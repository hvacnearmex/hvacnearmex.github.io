These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
