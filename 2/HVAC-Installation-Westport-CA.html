<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Westport CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
