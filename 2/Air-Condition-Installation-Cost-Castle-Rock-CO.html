<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Castle Rock CO</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home performance upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to assist us discuss which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the necessary electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the entire surface area of a floor heats up the lower half of the room, covering residents in warmth at a lower overall temperature-- in many cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating unit." In other words, in-floor heating systems offer a different mode and level of convenience. And, as numerous public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
