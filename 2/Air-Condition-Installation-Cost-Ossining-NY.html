<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Ossining NY</h3>
<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Lots of HVAC entrepreneur don't understand they require different rates schemes for different services that their company provides. For example, residential HVAC installation should be priced in a different way from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service ought to be priced in a different way from duct cleaning. If you are offering more than one service, you need to separate these into different departments, as if they were their own different service.<p>
<p>Because heating and cooling work might also require setting up or repairing plumbing to provide oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor might also be required to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a licensed plumbing professional on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this type of work. When getting a quote, make sure to ask not only if a company is licensed, but also what kind of license it holds.<p>
