<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Bowersville GA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on unusual events.<p>
