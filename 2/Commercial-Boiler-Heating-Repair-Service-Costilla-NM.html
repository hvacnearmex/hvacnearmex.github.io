<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
