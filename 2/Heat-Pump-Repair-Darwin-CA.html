<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
