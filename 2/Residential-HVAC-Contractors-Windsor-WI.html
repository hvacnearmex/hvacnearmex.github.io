<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
