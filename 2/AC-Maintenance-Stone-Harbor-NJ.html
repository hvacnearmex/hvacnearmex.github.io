<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The main reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services used. If the system is new and still under a maker's guarantee, the cost may not be rewarding. Any significant repairs should be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. Nevertheless, some producers need regular maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
