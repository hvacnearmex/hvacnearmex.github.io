Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But much of the things people do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of airborne pollutants in their homes and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>Excellent contractors use load-calculating software that factors in such data as the number of windows in your home, the density of insulation, the setup of the attic, and the building's orientation to the sun.

An air conditioner likewise decreases indoor pollen count - another plus for allergy -sufferers.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Direct exposure Evaluation Approach (GROUP) research studies found levels of about a dozen common organic toxins to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the houses were located in rural or highly industrial locations.
