<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtering. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants streaming through your system. They can likewise keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
