<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to buy it. My better half stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have actually satisfied in a long period of time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
