To ensure the unit you pick is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation quote to determine the specific kind of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply change it with the exact same size system you presently have.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
