<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
