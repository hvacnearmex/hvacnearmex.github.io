<p>Among the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly costly to install, particularly in an older home. Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. Furthermore, specific fuels and equipment may require special licenses, and there is minimal flexibility in the event of changed heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the living space.<p>

This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
