<h3>Residential HVAC in West MS</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
