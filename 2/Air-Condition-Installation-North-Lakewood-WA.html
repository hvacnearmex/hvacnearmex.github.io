<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Purchase education and training: HVAC is not "rule of thumb" work, and no two houses are the same. When service technicians are properly trained, they select and set up efficient, safe equipment. They know what it means to offer first-class craftsmanship, and they get less callbacks from dissatisfied clients. Supervisors and founders should also stay abreast of developing innovations and industry best practices.<p>

<p>While pollutants commonly found in indoor air are responsible for numerous harmful impacts, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are required to produce specific health problems. People likewise respond very differently to exposure to indoor air contaminants. More research is needed to better comprehend which health results take place after direct exposure to the average toxin concentrations discovered in houses and which occur from the higher concentrations that happen for short periods of time.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-term indoor air quality issue is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference area.
