<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My eldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t truly think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
