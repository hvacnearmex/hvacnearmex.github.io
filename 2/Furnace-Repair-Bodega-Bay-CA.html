<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me concern and a lower rate.

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
