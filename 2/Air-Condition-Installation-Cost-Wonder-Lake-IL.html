<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can often be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent ought to ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
