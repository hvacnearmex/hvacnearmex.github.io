<h3>Central Air Conditioning System in Palm Beach FL</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>It is not useful to design a universal guideline suitable for all in regards to direct exposure and health because immunity differs significantly from individual to individual. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a ten years study analyzing more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 environmental samples that were collected across the United States and abroad. The building type included both commercial and residential. The majority of samples analyzed were tested positive for fungis and bacteria.<p>
