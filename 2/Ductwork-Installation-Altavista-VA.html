<h3>HVAC Service in Altavista VA</h3>
<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
