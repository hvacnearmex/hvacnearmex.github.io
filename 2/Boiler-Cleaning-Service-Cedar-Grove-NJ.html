These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
