Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family home installation company entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to approximately 3 months.

Longtime Seattle property owners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
