<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities.

The good news is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can fail in the extremely hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
