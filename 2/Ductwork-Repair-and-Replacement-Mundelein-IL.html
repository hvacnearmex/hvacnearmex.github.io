<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time.

I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
