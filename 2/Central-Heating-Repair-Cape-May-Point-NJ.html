<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.

<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
