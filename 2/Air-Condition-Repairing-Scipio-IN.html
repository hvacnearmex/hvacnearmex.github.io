After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

In turn, the items in the room, like furniture and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature level.<p>
