<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
