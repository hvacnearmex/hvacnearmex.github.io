<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it through software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
