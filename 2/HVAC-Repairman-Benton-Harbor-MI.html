<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
<p>For instance, contaminants might collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outside pollutant, it might act as a path to carry the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working along with it needs to-- if particles is blocking the outside air intake, for example, or the filters are contaminated or inadequately maintained.<p>

PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While space a/c provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
