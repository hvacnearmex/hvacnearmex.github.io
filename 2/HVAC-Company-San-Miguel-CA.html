If your HVAC unit is not draining correctly, you'll have a water leakage. A constraint in your drain pipes triggers a water leak. There are many different places a blockage can happen. Among the primary areas where blockages start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>A fan belt, also referred to as a drive belt, is a belt linking your vehicle's engine to the front installed devices.
