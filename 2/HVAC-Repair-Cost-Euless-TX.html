<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
