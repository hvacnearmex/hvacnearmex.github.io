<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>There are some more severe risks for HVAC workers that might be potentially deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be dangerous. As HVAC technicians regularly come into contact with wiring, they run the risk of being electrocuted. They can likewise suffer other types of abrasions and burns to the skin. Although there are threats associated with the job, it is usually carried out securely as long as appropriate care is taken.<p>
<p>It is not recommended that "regular" occupational exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to figure out if the basic indoor air quality meets a specific standard. Occupational direct exposure limits noted in health and wellness guidelines and the Threshold Limitation Values ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to avoid illness or certain results (like eye and nose inflammation) in commercial circumstances. These limitations may not be appropriate in workplace settings or for the home.<p>
