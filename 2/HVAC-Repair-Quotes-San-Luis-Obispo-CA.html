<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
