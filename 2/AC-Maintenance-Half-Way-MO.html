<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the building (e.g., workplace devices; flooring, furniture and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
