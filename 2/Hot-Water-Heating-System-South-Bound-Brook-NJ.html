<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to maintain and understand.<p>
