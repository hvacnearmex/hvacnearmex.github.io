<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your home, however there are many other contaminants that can not only unclean up the air, but lead to other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products add to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unstable natural substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
