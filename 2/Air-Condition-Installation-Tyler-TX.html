<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can exacerbate problems.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
