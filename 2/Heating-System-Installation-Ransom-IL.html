<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has actually recognized building materials, home furnishings, and mold as severe concerns, but much of the threat likewise comes from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can create contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
