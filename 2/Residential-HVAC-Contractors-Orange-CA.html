<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Orange CA</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive moisture, presents outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
