<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
