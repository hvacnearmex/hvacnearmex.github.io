<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply.

<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path.
