<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
