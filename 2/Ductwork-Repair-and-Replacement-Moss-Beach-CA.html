<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
