<h3>AC Service in Oreland PA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
