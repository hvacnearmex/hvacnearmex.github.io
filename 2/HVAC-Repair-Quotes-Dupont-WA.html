<p>Most well and city water does not typically include lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the house from family plumbing that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked, the only method to understand. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water checked.

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
