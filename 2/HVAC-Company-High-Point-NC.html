<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Want to Understand in High Point NC</h3>
<p>I was very delighted in the beginning since things ran smoothly with no sound. Furthermore, I saw visible changes in my electrical energy bills. After 2 years, things started to change. There have actually been awkward noises. I got it fixed and examined. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. However then recognized Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
