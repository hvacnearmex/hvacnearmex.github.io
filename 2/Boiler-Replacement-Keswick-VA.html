<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.
