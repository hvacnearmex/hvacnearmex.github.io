<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
