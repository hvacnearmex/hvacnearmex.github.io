<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

Likewise, if the procedure doesn't work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you discover you have to do it frequently, it's most likely time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
