<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.
