<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Oil heating units are less typical now than gas, but they can be useful in more remote regions where utilities are harder to gain access to, and in cooler environments due to the fact that it offers more heat per BTU than other services. The installation cost will be lower, however energy expenses will be higher, as much as 3 times greater than gas or electric heaters. They require a storage tank on the immediate property and more maintenance. In general, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day.

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
