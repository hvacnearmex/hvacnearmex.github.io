<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
