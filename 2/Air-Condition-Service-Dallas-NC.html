You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are usually not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but a lot of do not attain an effectiveness higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.
