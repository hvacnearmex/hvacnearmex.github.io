Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any air flow limitation will decrease the system's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces are usually not extremely efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but a lot of do not attain an effectiveness higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.
