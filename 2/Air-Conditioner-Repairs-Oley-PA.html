<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Oley PA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season.
