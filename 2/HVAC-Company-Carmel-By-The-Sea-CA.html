<p>A customized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
