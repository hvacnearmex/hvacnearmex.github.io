<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also produce particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
