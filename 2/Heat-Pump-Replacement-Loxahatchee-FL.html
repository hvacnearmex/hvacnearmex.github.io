<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly.
