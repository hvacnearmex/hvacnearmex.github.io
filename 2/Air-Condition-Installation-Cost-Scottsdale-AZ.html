<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently.

<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Scottsdale AZ Home Owners</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
