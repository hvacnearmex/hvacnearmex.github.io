<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution.

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to make sure a healthy environment.
