Maintenance and repair work, however, typically remains reasonably stable.

<p>Individuals who dislike these contaminants need to use allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and avoid room home furnishings that collect dust, specifically if they can not be washed in hot water. Allergic people must also leave the house while it is being vacuumed because vacuuming can in fact increase airborne levels of mite irritants and other biological contaminants. Using central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high effectiveness filters may also be of assistance.<p>
