High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
