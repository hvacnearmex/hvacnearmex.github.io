<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
