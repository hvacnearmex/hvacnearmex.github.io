<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Cameron OK</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we resolved issues. I would suggest this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Many disconnect blocks contain 2 cartridge merges. Inspect them prior to you continue with repairs (Picture 3). A blown fuse signifies a stopping working part inside the condensing system. So do not just replace it and think you have actually solved the problem. Instead, change the parts we show here. Then set up new fuses and fire up the unit. Call a pro-- you have actually got more severe concerns if it blows again.<p>
