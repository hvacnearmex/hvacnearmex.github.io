<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
