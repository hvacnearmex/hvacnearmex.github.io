<p>Sean was very valuable. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
