<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
