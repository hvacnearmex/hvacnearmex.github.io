An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the very first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial structures, apartment buildings and huge residences.
