<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Also, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to install the air conditioning system: Don't position it in an egress window that functions as the only means of escape must a fire erupt.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but lots of use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better option. If the present system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
