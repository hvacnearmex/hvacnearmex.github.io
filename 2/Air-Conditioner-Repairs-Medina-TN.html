<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Medina TN</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require fairly little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is essential to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leakages, the system must be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in hard water locations). The systems should be examined at least twice per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
