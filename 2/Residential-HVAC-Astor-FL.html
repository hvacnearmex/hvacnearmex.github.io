<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
