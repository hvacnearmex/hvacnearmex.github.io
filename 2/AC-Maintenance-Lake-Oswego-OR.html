Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, stability Energy was quick to respond. They appeared the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heating systems can heat the house. Truthfully, our house heating unit is made complex, Rob and his group repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
