<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Numerous individuals are becoming more worried and aware about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt including toxins and irritants can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Sometimes it must be removed to refresh the quality and boost of indoor air and improve the cooling.
