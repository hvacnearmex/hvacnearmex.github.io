<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home.

Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

Plus, there's even an added cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
