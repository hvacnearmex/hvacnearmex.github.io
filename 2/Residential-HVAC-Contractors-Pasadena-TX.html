<h3>Furnace Installation Near me in Pasadena TX</h3>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Pasadena TX?</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
