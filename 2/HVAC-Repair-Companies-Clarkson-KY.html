<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to evaluate and, if essential, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

Location control includes moving the toxin source away from occupants or even relocating prone residents.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heaters While oil is typically used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the exact same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
