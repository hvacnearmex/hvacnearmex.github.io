<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening.
