<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two must not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the form of electricity. The two operations utilize different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
