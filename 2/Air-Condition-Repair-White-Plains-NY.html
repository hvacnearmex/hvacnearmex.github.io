<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
