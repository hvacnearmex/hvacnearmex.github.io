<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
