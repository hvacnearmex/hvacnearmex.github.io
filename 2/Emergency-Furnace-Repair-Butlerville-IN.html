<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and structure residents might be exposed to a variety of pollutants (in the form of gases and particles) from workplace devices, cleaning products, construction furnishings, activities and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outdoor toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about prospective results of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's instructions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater correctly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
