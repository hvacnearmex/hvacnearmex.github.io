<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a consistent temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season.

<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
