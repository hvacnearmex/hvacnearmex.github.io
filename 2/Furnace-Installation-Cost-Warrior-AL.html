Whether you're having an issue with irregular cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific House & Comfort, Inc. has the services and products you require.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Second of all like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
