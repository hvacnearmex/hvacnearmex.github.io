<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major elements fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
