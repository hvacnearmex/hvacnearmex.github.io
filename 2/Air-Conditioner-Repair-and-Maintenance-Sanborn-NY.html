<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Sanborn NY Home Owners</h3>

As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
