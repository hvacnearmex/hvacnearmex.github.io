He said the selling firms have actually originated from a range of sources, including service brokers, financial planners, and owners who found out about him through word of mouth.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
