Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
