<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
