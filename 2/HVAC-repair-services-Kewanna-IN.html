<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
