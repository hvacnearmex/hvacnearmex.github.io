The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.

Hope this assists.<p>
