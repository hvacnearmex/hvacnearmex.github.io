<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Furnaces that kick on often might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
