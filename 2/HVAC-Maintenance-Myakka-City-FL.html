<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
