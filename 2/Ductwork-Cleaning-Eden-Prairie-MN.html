<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Eden Prairie MN?</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
