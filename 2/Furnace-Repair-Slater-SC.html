<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Place control involves moving the pollutant source far from occupants and even transferring susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats.

<p>A specialized ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a basic ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the exact same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
