<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Rogers AR</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

Took care of a part that was not covered under service warranty fast and effective and did not have to pay an arm and a leg to get it done.

I am currently on the maintance plan. He looks after it two times a year with out having to be advised to do it.<p>
