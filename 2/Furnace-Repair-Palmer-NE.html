What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Through regular usage and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system might become extremely dirty.

This is an excellent opportunity to identify parts that are worn or malfunctioning. When the problem is fairly small, changing them to repair the air conditioning might be a lot less costly.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working, integrity Energy was quick to react. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new heating systems can heat the house. Truthfully, our home heater is made complex, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work perfectly.<p>
