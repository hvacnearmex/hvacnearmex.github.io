<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in location. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one response specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repeated usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  an extremely helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
