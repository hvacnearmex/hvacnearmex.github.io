<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heater the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to keeping an appropriate temperature level.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "regular" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to figure out if the general indoor air quality fulfills a particular standard. Occupational exposure limitations noted in health and safety policies and the Limit Limit Values ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to avoid disease or certain impacts (like eye and nose inflammation) in industrial circumstances. These limits might not be suitable in office settings or for the home.<p>
