Either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. Just adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages.

Keep in mind that the efficiency and performance of your ac system is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
