<p>We look at hints before we supply advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older system.<p>

Ask us about our maintenance program that can conserve you 25 percent on service over the life of your system. Because when you look after your furnace, it will look after you with lower energy bills, less repairs, and more years of convenience.<p>
