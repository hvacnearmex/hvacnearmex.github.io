<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Because it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>

Depending on the kind of unit set up, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're highly allergic to dust.

Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
