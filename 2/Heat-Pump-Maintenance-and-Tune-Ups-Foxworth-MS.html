<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
