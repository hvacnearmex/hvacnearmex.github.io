<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
