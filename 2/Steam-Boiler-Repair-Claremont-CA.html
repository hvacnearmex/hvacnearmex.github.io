<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>The EPA suggests that you have your air ducts inspected by an expert heating and cooling contractor. If your technician finds that your air ducts have significant mold, dust, dirt, and other pollutants or a musty odor, they may suggest duct cleaning This is particularly important if someone in your home has asthma, allergies, or other symptoms that might be associated with indoor air contamination.<p>
