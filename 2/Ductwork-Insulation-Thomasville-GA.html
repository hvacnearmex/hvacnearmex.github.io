"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized.
