<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Grand Junction CO Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I proceeded and bought this Provider and I need to say it does the job quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool down the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had before. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
