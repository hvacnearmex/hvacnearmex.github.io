<p>Many people don't understand how humidity is gotten rid of from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the space that is being cooled.

One of the main locations where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
