<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Faith NC</h3>
<p>Sometimes, heating repairs are simply not possible. Perhaps your furnace is too old, your heatpump is too damaged, or your boiler just can't be fixed. Whatever the case, particular instances require full-scale heating replacement. At Horizon Services, we have actually been helping property owners throughout Delaware, Southern New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Northeastern Maryland change their homes' heater when their old ones are no longer functional.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
