<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were informative and valuable, Ballard Gas offered us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located methods we might have more even heat.
