I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from beginning to end were really expert, courteous and the work was very effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.
