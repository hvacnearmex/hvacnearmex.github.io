<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Kids may have greater direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
