<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
