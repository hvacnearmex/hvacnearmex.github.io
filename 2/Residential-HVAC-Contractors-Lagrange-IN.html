Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
