Although temperatures are typically in the convenience range, some specialist procedures, such as open heart surgical treatment, require low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, relatively high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both comfort and process applications, the goal might be to not only manage temperature, however likewise humidity, air quality, and air motion from space to area.<p>
<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
