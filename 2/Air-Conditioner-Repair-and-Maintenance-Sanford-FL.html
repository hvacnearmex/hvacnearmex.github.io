Their techs are professional and really educated. Expenses are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser this week. I did not trouble to get rival's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was certainly reasonable.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
