<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

Ilan has actually been wonderful through all these years. Constantly keeps my system serviced and tuned. Haven't had any issues.
