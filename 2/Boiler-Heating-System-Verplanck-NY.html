<p>Expert heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals recommend following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a new building. Forced air systems will need a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heat systems will require water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop required depends upon the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is vital iin ensuring the effectiveness and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is measured in loads. Generally, a 3-ton setup should be adequate for the typical home, however home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land availability are all factors which will influence the appropriate size for your particular home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
