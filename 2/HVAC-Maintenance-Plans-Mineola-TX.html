Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it significantly tough for your lungs to operate properly, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
